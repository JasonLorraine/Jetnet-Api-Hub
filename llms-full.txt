> This file is optimized for LLM context windows. For the full reference, see llms-full.txt.

## Common Use Cases

- Aircraft Sales & Brokerage: tail lookup, owner identification, for-sale inventory, comparable sales history
- Fleet Intelligence: fleet composition by model/country/operator, ownership tracking, lifecycle monitoring
- Market Analytics: pricing trends, inventory levels, days-on-market, supply/demand time-series
- CRM Enrichment: ownership contacts, flight activity, base airport, charter/fractional identification
- Data Integration: bulk export with delta sync, automated ownership change alerts, transaction monitoring
- Valuation & Diligence: market benchmarks, transaction history, utilization data, operating costs

See references/vertical-playbooks.md for 9 detailed industry-specific workflows.

## Authentication

POST /api/Admin/APILogin
Body: { "emailAddress": "...", "password": "..." }
Response: { "bearerToken": "...", "apiToken": "..." }

Rules:
- Field is `emailAddress` (capital A). Not `email`, `emailaddress`, or `email_address`.
- `bearerToken` goes in header: `Authorization: Bearer {bearerToken}`
- `apiToken` goes in URL path only: `/api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/N123AB/{apiToken}`
- Never put apiToken in headers or body. Never put bearerToken in the URL.
- Tokens expire after 60 minutes. Proactively refresh at 50 minutes.
- Validate with: GET /api/Admin/getAccountInfo/{apiToken}
- On "INVALID SECURITY TOKEN": re-login once and retry. Never loop.

## Critical Gotchas

1. HTTP 200 does NOT mean success. Always check `responsestatus` for "ERROR".
2. `transtype: ["None"]` not `[]` for all transaction types.
3. `forsale` is string `"true"`/`"false"` in requests, `"Y"`/`"N"` in bulk export responses.
4. Dates must be `MM/DD/YYYY` with leading zeros. Month first, not day.
5. `modlist: []` means no filter (all models), not empty results.
6. `aclist: []` means no filter (all aircraft), not empty results.
7. `maxpages: 0` from bulk export = single page. Use `max(maxpages, 1)`.
8. `companyrelation` (getRegNumber flat) vs `relationtype` (getRelationships nested) -- different endpoints use different field names.
9. `regnbr` (tail number) can change. Use `aircraftid` as your stable database key.
10. Pagination is 1-based (first page = 1, not 0).

## The Golden Path (Tail Lookup)

1. GET /api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/{tailNumber}/{apiToken} -> aircraftresult (includes aircraftid)
2. GET /api/Aircraft/getPictures/{aircraftid}/{apiToken} -> pictures[]
   POST /api/Aircraft/getRelationships/{apiToken} body: {"aclist":[aircraftid],"modlist":[]} -> relationships[]
   POST /api/Aircraft/getFlightDataPaged/{apiToken}/100/1 body: {"aclist":[aircraftid],"modlist":[],...} -> flightdata[]
3. POST /api/Aircraft/getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/100/1 body: {"aclist":[aircraftid],"modlist":[],"transtype":["None"],...} -> history[] (lazy)

All POST endpoints require a JSON body with at minimum aclist and modlist. See prompts/ or docs/ for full payload shapes.

  NOTE: Response transtype values are different (descriptive strings like "Full Sale - Retail to Retail"). Do not use response values in request payloads.

## ID System

| ID | Type | Purpose | Stable? |
|----|------|---------|---------|
| aircraftid | int | Primary key for aircraft, join key for all sub-records | Yes |
| regnbr | string | Tail number (human-readable) | No -- can change |

| transid | int | Transaction record ID (for dedup) | Yes |
| serialnbr | string | Manufacturer serial number | Yes |
| baseicao | string | Home airport (4-char ICAO code) | Changes |

## Model IDs (modlist)

872 unique model IDs across 67 makes and 5 make types.
Full machine-readable table: references/model-id-table.json

Common examples:
- Gulfstream G550: modlist [278]
- Gulfstream G650 + G650ER: modlist [663, 1211]
- Citation Latitude: modlist [1167]
- All Citation CJ3 variants: modlist [279, 1194]
- Challenger 350: modlist [1188]
- King Air 350: modlist [142]
- Bell 407: modlist [100]
- modlist: [] = no filter (all models)

## Pagination Pattern

URL: POST .../getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
Pages are 1-based. Use `maxpages` for loop control.

```python
results, page = [], 1
while True:
    data = api("POST", f"{path}/{pagesize}/{page}", bearer, token, body)
    for key in ["history","flightdata","events","aircraft","aircraftowneroperators","companylist","contactlist","relationships","aircraftcompfractionalrefs"]:
        if key in data and isinstance(data[key], list):
            results.extend(data[key])
            break
    if page >= max(data.get("maxpages", 1), 1):
        break
    page += 1
```

## Schema Differences (Owner/Operator)

| Endpoint | Schema | Relation Field |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| getRegNumber | Flat: companyname, contactfirstname | companyrelation |
| getRelationships / getHistoryList | Nested: company.name, contact.firstname | relationtype |
| getBulkAircraftExport | Prefixed: owrcompanyname, oprcompanyname | prefix (owr*, opr*, chp*) |
| getAcCompanyFractionalReportPaged | Flat: companyname | relation |

## Normalized Response Shapes

AircraftCard: aircraftId, modelId, tailNumber, serialNumber, make, model, yearMfr, yearDelivered, makeType, airframeType, weightClass, categorySize, lifecycle, forSale, owner (CompanyCard), operator (CompanyCard)

CompanyCard: companyId, name, city, state, country, phone, email, contact (ContactCard)

ContactCard: contactId, firstName, lastName, title, email, phone

GoldenPathResult: aircraftId, tailNumber, make, model, yearMfr, yearDelivered, categorySize, weightClass, forSale, askingPrice, owner, operator, chiefPilot, baseIcao, baseAirport, baseCountry, dataSource="JETNET"

## Bulk Export (getBulkAircraftExportPaged)

Two operating modes:
- Snapshot: omit `aircraftchanges` -> full dataset matching filters
- Delta: `aircraftchanges=true` -> aircraft with changes since your last API call (backend tracks this automatically)

Key behaviors:
- Delta uses graph-based change detection: aircraft qualifies if ANY related entity changes (ownership, contacts, events, flights) -- not just the aircraft record.
- Delta returns full records, not field-level diffs. Always upsert entire records.
- `aircraftchanges=true` means "since last call" -- the backend tracks the cursor, not the client.
- `actiondate`/`enddate` are optional date-range filters, not the change cursor. Accepts `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS`.
- Entity counts scale nonlinearly: each aircraft expands into companies, contacts, phones, events, flight summaries.
- Always scope with `modlist` or `aclist`. Unbounded queries create massive payloads.
- Response uses flat prefixed schema: owr* (owner), opr* (operator), chp* (chief pilot).
- `forsale` is "Y"/"N" (not "true"/"false"). `datepurchased` is YYYYMMDD.
- `maxpages: 0` = single page. Use max(maxpages, 1).

Integration pattern: initial full snapshot -> store locally -> periodic delta pulls with aircraftchanges=true -> upsert entire records.

## History Endpoints (getHistoryListPaged / getCompanyHistoryPaged)

History records are transaction EVENTS, not aircraft state. Each record = a sale, lease, transfer, or relationship change.

POST /api/Aircraft/getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
POST /api/Company/getCompanyHistoryPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}

Key behaviors:
- Response key: `history` (array). Uses nested relationship schema (company:{}, contact:{} sub-objects).
- `transtype` in request = categories ("FullSale", "Lease", "None"); in response = descriptive strings ("Full Sale - Retail to Retail").
- `isnewaircraft` and `isinternaltrans` are tristate: "Yes", "No", "Ignore".
- `allrelationships: true` returns all parties: Seller, Purchaser, Operator, Seller's Broker, Purchaser's Broker.
- `soldprice`/`askingprice` are often null (confidential deals). `transretail: true` = arm's length retail transaction.
- `transdate` = actual transaction date. `actiondate` = when JETNET last updated the record.
- History records are event pointers — enrich with getRelationships/getAircraftList/getCompany for full context.
- Always provide startdate/enddate + modelid/modlist/companyid to bound queries.

Use cases: ownership timeline (sort by transdate ASC), comparable sales (transtype=FullSale + transretail), leasing intelligence, change detection alerts.

## Snapshot Endpoint (getCondensedSnapshot)

Returns frozen fleet ownership/operator state at a specific historical date. A "time machine" for fleet composition.

POST /api/Aircraft/getCondensedSnapshot/{apiToken}

Key behaviors:
- `snapshotdate` (MM/DD/YYYY) is the required defining parameter.
- Response key: `snapshotowneroperators` (array).
- Non-paged: returns full dataset in one response (can be multi-MB).
- Always filter by modlist, basecountry, maketype, or aclist to keep payloads manageable.
- Snapshot data is historical and immutable — cache aggressively.
- Conceptual model: Snapshot=STATE, History=CHANGE, Current=NOW, FlightData=ACTIVITY.

Use cases: historical fleet composition, "who owned this in year X?", market comparison across years, country fleet growth analysis.

## Model Market Trends (getModelMarketTrends)

POST /api/Model/getModelMarketTrends/{apiToken}

Monthly time-series at model-level granularity. One record per model per month.

Request: modlist (array of model IDs), displayRange (months), startdate (MM/DD/YYYY).
Response key: `modelMarketTrends` (camelCase with capital M).

Key fields per record: trend_year, trend_month, aircraft_for_sale_count, in_operation_count, avg_asking_price, high_asking_price, low_asking_price, avg_daysonmarket, avg_airframe_time, avg_engine_time, domestic_count, international_count, dealer_owned_count, end_user_count.

Derived metrics:
- Supply Pressure = aircraft_for_sale_count / in_operation_count
- Liquidity Score = inverse of avg_daysonmarket slope
- Price Trend Index = MoM change in avg_asking_price

Combine with Snapshots (state), History (transactions), Events (causal), and Flight Data (utilization) for full longitudinal analytics. See docs/trends.md for composite indicators and architecture.

## Events (getEventListPaged)

POST /api/Aircraft/getEventListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}

Discrete, timestamped aircraft lifecycle changes. The atomic causal layer of the dataset.

Request: evcategory (array), evtype (array), startdate/enddate (MM/DD/YYYY), aclist, modlist.
Response key: `events` (array). Fields: aircraftid, make, model, sernbr, regnbr, yearmfr, date (ISO), subject, description.

Key behaviors:
- evcategory and evtype enum values are STRICT. Unrecognized values return errors inside responsestatus (HTTP 200).
- Use [] for both evcategory and evtype to return all events (safest default).
- Call GET /api/Utility/getEventCategories/{apiToken} and POST /api/Utility/getEventTypes/{apiToken} to discover valid values.
- Known categories: Aircraft Information, Company / Contact, Financial Documents, Market Status, Transaction.
- Example types: Change in Aircraft Base, Change in Airframe Total Time, Ownership Transfer, For Sale / Off Market.
- Priority: Transaction + Market Status = HIGH, Aircraft Information = MEDIUM, Financial Documents + Company/Contact = LOW.
- Events explain WHY snapshots and trends changed (ownership transfers, listings, accidents, lifecycle transitions).
- Use for: lifecycle timelines, market velocity, ownership churn, pre-listing detection, event-driven alerts, signal engines.

Analytics stack: EVENTS (raw) -> SNAPSHOTS (state) -> TRENDS (analytics).

## Flight Data Endpoints

Two endpoints for flight intelligence:

getFlightData (POST, paged) -- Granular per-flight records. Response key: flightdata.
  Required filters: startdate/enddate (MM/DD/YYYY), plus modlist or aclist.
  Fields: flightid, flightdate, origin, destination, flighttime, distance, estfuelburn, estCO2emissions, callsign.
  Ingestion strategy: batch by model + daily/weekly date windows.

getFlights (GET) -- GET /api/Aircraft/getFlights/{aircraftId}/{apiToken}
  Monthly utilization aggregates: flightyear, flightmonth, flights (count), flighthours.
  Response key: flights.
  Use for: utilization trends, CRM scoring, benchmarking.

Use getFlightData for route intelligence and emissions. Use getFlights for monthly trend analysis.

## Contact Endpoints

Contact is a relationship hub connecting companies, aircraft, and listings. Join key: contactid.

getContactListPaged (POST, paged) -- Search contacts by name, company, role.
  Response key: contactlist. Fields: contactid, firstname, lastname, title, companyname, companyid.

getContact (GET) -- Full contact record by contactid.
  URL: /api/Contact/getContact/{contactId}/{apiToken}
  Response key: contact. Fields: contactid, firstname, lastname, title, suffix, companyname, companyid, address fields.

getIdentification (GET) -- Lightweight identification record.
  URL: /api/Contact/getIdentification/{contactId}/{apiToken}

getPhonenumbers (GET) -- Phone numbers for a contact. Returns null (not []) when empty.
  URL: /api/Contact/getPhonenumbers/{contactId}/{apiToken}

getOtherlistings (GET) -- Alternate company/contact associations.
  URL: /api/Contact/getOtherlistings/{contactId}/{apiToken}

getContAircraftRelationships (GET) -- Aircraft linked to a contact with relationship type.
  URL: /api/Contact/getContAircraftRelationships/{contactId}/{apiToken}

Workflow: search (getContactListPaged) → verify (getIdentification) → full profile (getContact) → aircraft linkage (getContAircraftRelationships) → phones → other listings.

## Company Endpoints

Company is the organizational node linking contacts, aircraft, and certifications. Join key: companyid.

getCompanyListPaged (POST, paged) -- Search companies by name, type, location.
  Response key: companylist. Fields: companyid, companyname, city, state, country.

getCompany (POST) -- Full company record by companyid.
  Response key: company. Includes nested objects.

getContacts (GET) -- Returns contact ID arrays only (not full objects). N+1 fan-out risk.
  URL: /api/Company/getContacts/{companyId}/{apiToken}

getAircraftrelationships (GET) -- Aircraft tied to company with relationship details.
  isoperator is "Y"/"N" string, not boolean. ownerpercent can be null.

getRelatedcompanies (GET) -- Parent/child/affiliated companies. Returns null (not []) when empty.

getCompanyCertifications (GET) -- Regulatory certifications.

getCompanyHistory / getCompanyHistoryPaged -- Transaction history for a company.

Workflow: search (getCompanyListPaged) → validate (getCompany) → expand (getContacts, getAircraftrelationships) → link.

## Model Reference Endpoints

Four model-level endpoints keyed by modelid (AMODID). Cross-reference: references/model-id-table.json.

getModelMarketTrends (POST) -- See docs/trends.md. Response key: modelMarketTrends (camelCase).

getModelOperationCosts (POST) -- Operating cost projections. Response key: modeloperationcosts (lowercase).
  Key fields: fuel burn rate, cost categories, annualhours, fuelprice projections.
  Request body: ModelPerformanceOptions with modelid.

getModelPerformanceSpecs (POST) -- Airframe specs. Response key: modelperformancespecs (lowercase).
  Key fields: fuselage dimensions, cabin specs, range, speed, ceiling.

getModelIntelligence (POST) -- Model-level intelligence summary.

IMPORTANT: Response key casing is inconsistent -- modelMarketTrends (camelCase) vs modeloperationcosts/modelperformancespecs (lowercase).

## Airport Reference

getAirportList (POST) -- Geographic dimension table. Cache aggressively (low change frequency).
  URL: /api/Utility/getAirportList/{apiToken}
  Request params: name, city, state, statename, country, iata, icao, faaid.
  Response fields: airportid, name, city, state, country, iata, icao, faaid.
  Use ICAO as canonical key. Joins with flight data, events, snapshots for geographic analysis.

## Utility / Reference Endpoints

Cacheable dimension tables forming the metadata backbone. All via /api/Utility/.

getAircraftLifecycleStatus -- Lifecycle enum values. Cache: static (months).
getAircraftMakeList -- Manufacturer taxonomy. Cache: long-lived (weekly).
getAircraftModelList -- Model catalog with modelid, weightclass, categorysize. Cache: long-lived (weekly).
getAirframeJniqSizes -- JNIQ size categories. Cache: static.
getAirframeTypes -- FixedWing, Rotary. Cache: static.
getMakeTypeList -- Make type taxonomy. Cache: long-lived.
getWeightClassTypes -- Weight class categories. Cache: static.
getEventCategories -- 5 event categories. Cache: static.
getEventTypes -- Event type enum per category. Cache: static.
getCompanyBusinessTypes -- Business type taxonomy. Cache: long-lived.
getCountryList / getStateList -- Geographic reference. Cache: static.

Strategy: load all static endpoints once at startup, cache long-lived weekly, refresh session-level daily.

# Authentication

## Login Endpoint

All JETNET API calls require authentication via the login endpoint:

```http
POST https://customer.jetnetconnect.com/api/Admin/APILogin
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "emailAddress": "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

> **Important:** The field is `emailAddress` with a capital **A**. This is the single most common auth mistake. It is not `email`, `emailaddress`, or `email_address`.

## Response Tokens

A successful login returns two tokens:

| Token | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `bearerToken` | Sent in the `Authorization` header on every request |
| `apiToken` | Inserted into the URL path on every request (also called `securityToken` in some docs — same field) |

## Using Tokens on Subsequent Calls

Every API call after login requires both tokens:

1. **Header:** `Authorization: Bearer {bearerToken}`
2. **URL path:** Replace `{apiToken}` in the endpoint path with your actual `apiToken` value

The `apiToken` goes **in the URL path only** — never in headers or the JSON body.

### Example

```
GET /api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/N123AB/{apiToken}
Authorization: Bearer {bearerToken}
```

## Two-Tier Model

JETNET uses a two-tier model for API usage:

| Tier | Use Case | Characteristics |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Tier A — Interactive** | Tail lookup, owner/operator, pictures, quick flight summary, CRM enrichment | One aircraft at a time, low volume, user is waiting |
| **Tier B — Bulk / Data Engineering** | Nightly sync, history exports, analytics pipelines, large event windows | Always paged, run async, never drive a live UI off these |

If building an app or a script for a salesperson: **Tier A**.
If a customer asks about bulk export, nightly refresh, or history across thousands of aircraft: **Tier B**.

## Environment Variable Setup

Store your credentials in environment variables — never hard-code them:

```bash
export JETNET_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
export JETNET_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

## Token Refresh Pattern

Tokens expire after **60 minutes**. For long-running pipelines, proactively re-login before expiry rather than waiting for a failure.

### Python

```python
import time, os, requests

BASE = "https://customer.jetnetconnect.com"
token_issued = 0
TOKEN_TTL = 50 * 60  # refresh after 50 min (tokens last 60 min)

def login(email, password):
    r = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/Admin/APILogin",
                      json={"emailAddress": email, "password": password})
    r.raise_for_status()
    d = r.json()
    return d["bearerToken"], d["apiToken"]

def get_tokens():
    global bearer, token, token_issued
    if time.time() - token_issued > TOKEN_TTL:
        bearer, token = login(os.environ["JETNET_EMAIL"], os.environ["JETNET_PASSWORD"])
        token_issued = time.time()
    return bearer, token
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const BASE = "https://customer.jetnetconnect.com";
let bearerToken, apiToken, tokenIssued = 0;
const TOKEN_TTL = 50 * 60 * 1000; // 50 minutes in ms

async function login(email, password) {
  const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/api/Admin/APILogin`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ emailAddress: email, password })
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`Login failed: ${res.status}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  return { bearerToken: data.bearerToken, apiToken: data.apiToken };
}

async function getTokens() {
  if (Date.now() - tokenIssued > TOKEN_TTL) {
    const tokens = await login(process.env.JETNET_EMAIL, process.env.JETNET_PASSWORD);
    bearerToken = tokens.bearerToken;
    apiToken = tokens.apiToken;
    tokenIssued = Date.now();
  }
  return { bearerToken, apiToken };
}
```

## Retry on INVALID SECURITY TOKEN

When you receive `"ERROR: INVALID SECURITY TOKEN"` in the `responsestatus` field:

1. Re-login to get fresh tokens
2. Retry the failed request once with the new tokens
3. **Never loop** — if it fails again, surface the error

```python
def api(method, path, bearer, token, body=None):
    url = f"{BASE}{path}".replace("{apiToken}", token)
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {bearer}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    r = requests.request(method, url, headers=headers, json=body)
    r.raise_for_status()
    result = r.json()
    status = result.get("responsestatus", "").upper()
    if "INVALID SECURITY TOKEN" in status:
        bearer, token = login(os.environ["JETNET_EMAIL"], os.environ["JETNET_PASSWORD"])
        r = requests.request(method, url.replace(token, token), headers=headers, json=body)
        r.raise_for_status()
        result = r.json()
    if "ERROR" in result.get("responsestatus", "").upper():
        raise ValueError(f"JETNET error: {result['responsestatus']}")
    return result
```

## Recommended: Session Helpers

For production apps, use the session helpers instead of managing tokens manually. They handle login, proactive refresh, `/getAccountInfo` validation, and auto-retry:

**Python** — [`src/jetnet/session.py`](../src/jetnet/session.py)

```python
from src.jetnet.session import login, ensure_session, jetnet_request

session = login("you@example.com", "password", "https://customer.jetnetconnect.com")
session = ensure_session(session)
result = jetnet_request("GET", "/api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/N1KE/{apiToken}", session)
```

**TypeScript** — [`src/jetnet/session.ts`](../src/jetnet/session.ts)

```typescript
import { login, ensureSession, jetnetRequest } from "../../src/jetnet/session";

let session = await login(email, password, baseUrl);
session = await ensureSession(session);
const result = await jetnetRequest("GET", "/api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/N1KE/{apiToken}", session);
```

## Token Validation with /getAccountInfo

`GET /api/Admin/getAccountInfo/{apiToken}` is a lightweight endpoint that returns your account details. Use it as a health check before long workflows:

- Cheap call — no data payload, fast response
- If it returns a valid response, your token is good
- If it returns `INVALID SECURITY TOKEN`, re-login once and retry
- The session helpers call this automatically via `ensure_session()`

To measure the actual TTL for your tenant:

```bash
python scripts/token_probe.py
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never expose tokens in client-side code (browser or mobile app)
- Always proxy JETNET calls through your own backend
- Store credentials in environment variables or a secrets manager
- Do not log tokens in production

# Pagination

## When to Use Paged Endpoints

Use `Paged` endpoint variants for history, flight data, events, bulk export, company lists, and contact lists. Non-paged versions time out on large datasets.

| Endpoint | Paged Variant |
|----------|--------------|
| `getHistoryList` | `getHistoryListPaged` |
| `getFlightData` | `getFlightDataPaged` |
| `getEventList` | `getEventListPaged` |
| `getBulkAircraftExport` | Always paged |
| `getCompanyList` | `getCompanyListPaged` |
| `getContactList` | `getContactListPaged` |
| `getCondensedOwnerOperators` | `getCondensedOwnerOperatorsPaged` |

## URL Pattern

```
POST .../getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
```

- `{pagesize}` — number of records per page (typically `100`)
- `{page}` — **1-based** (first page = `1`, not `0`)

## Response Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `maxpages` | Total number of pages available |
| `count` | Records on **this page** (not total records) |
| `currentpage` | The page you requested |
| `responsestatus` | Status string like `"SUCCESS: PAGE [ 1 of 428 ]"` |

Use `maxpages` for loop control — do not parse the `responsestatus` string.

## LIST_KEYS

Paged responses contain the data array under one of these keys:

```
history, flightdata, events, aircraft, aircraftowneroperators,
companylist, contactlist, relationships, aircraftcompfractionalrefs
```

## Pagination Loop — Python

```python
LIST_KEYS = {
    "history", "flightdata", "events", "aircraft",
    "aircraftowneroperators", "companylist", "contactlist",
    "relationships", "aircraftcompfractionalrefs"
}

def get_all_pages(bearer, token, paged_path, body, pagesize=100):
    results, page = [], 1
    while True:
        data = api("POST", f"{paged_path}/{pagesize}/{page}", bearer, token, body)
        for key in LIST_KEYS:
            if key in data and isinstance(data[key], list):
                results.extend(data[key])
                break
        if page >= data.get("maxpages", 1):
            break
        page += 1
    return results
```

## Pagination Loop — JavaScript

```javascript
const LIST_KEYS = new Set([
  "history", "flightdata", "events", "aircraft",
  "aircraftowneroperators", "companylist", "contactlist",
  "relationships", "aircraftcompfractionalrefs"
]);

async function getAllPages(bearerToken, apiToken, pagedPath, body, pagesize = 100) {
  const results = [];
  let page = 1;
  while (true) {
    const data = await api("POST", `${pagedPath}/${pagesize}/${page}`, bearerToken, apiToken, body);
    for (const key of LIST_KEYS) {
      if (Array.isArray(data[key])) {
        results.push(...data[key]);
        break;
      }
    }
    if (page >= (data.maxpages || 1)) break;
    page++;
  }
  return results;
}
```

## getBulkAircraftExport — maxpages:0 Quirk

`getBulkAircraftExport` returns `maxpages: 0` and `currentpage: 0` when **all results fit in a single response**. If your loop checks `page >= maxpages` before processing, you will exit immediately and miss all records.

**Fix:** Use `Math.max(maxpages, 1)` (or `max(maxpages, 1)` in Python) in your loop condition:

```python
def get_bulk_export(bearer, token, body, pagesize=100):
    results, page = [], 1
    while True:
        data = api("POST",
                   f"/api/Aircraft/getBulkAircraftExport/{token}/{pagesize}/{page}",
                   bearer, token, body)
        results.extend(data.get("aircraft", []))
        if page >= max(data.get("maxpages", 1), 1):
            break
        page += 1
    return results
```

```javascript
async function getBulkExport(bearerToken, apiToken, body, pagesize = 100) {
  const results = [];
  let page = 1;
  while (true) {
    const data = await api("POST",
      `/api/Aircraft/getBulkAircraftExport/${apiToken}/${pagesize}/${page}`,
      bearerToken, apiToken, body);
    results.push(...(data.aircraft || []));
    if (page >= Math.max(data.maxpages || 1, 1)) break;
    page++;
  }
  return results;
}
```

# Response Handling

## HTTP 200 Does Not Mean Success

JETNET returns HTTP 200 for most responses, including errors. You must always check the `responsestatus` field in the JSON body:

```python
result = r.json()
if "ERROR" in result.get("responsestatus", "").upper():
    raise ValueError(f"JETNET error: {result['responsestatus']}")
```

```javascript
const data = await res.json();
if ((data.responsestatus || "").toUpperCase().includes("ERROR")) {
  throw new Error(`JETNET error: ${data.responsestatus}`);
}
```

## responsestatus Values

| Status Pattern | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| `"SUCCESS"` | Request succeeded (non-paged) |
| `"SUCCESS: PAGE [ 1 of 428 ]"` | Paged request succeeded |
| `"ERROR: INVALID SECURITY TOKEN"` | Token expired — re-login and retry once |
| `"ERROR: ..."` | Any other error — do not retry, surface the message |

## companyrelationships Schema Differences

The `companyrelationships` structure **differs by endpoint**. This is the single biggest source of bugs when working across multiple JETNET endpoints.

| Endpoint | Schema | Relation Field | Relation Values |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `getRegNumber` | **Flat** — prefixed fields (`companyname`, `contactfirstname`) | `companyrelation` | `"Owner"`, `"Operator"`, `"Chief Pilot"` |
| `getAircraftList` | Not present | — | — |
| `getHistoryList` / `getRelationships` | **Nested** — `company: {}`, `contact: {}` sub-objects | `relationtype` | `"Owner"`, `"Operator"`, `"Seller"`, `"Purchaser"`, `"Seller's Broker"` |
| `getBulkAircraftExport` | **Flat prefixed by role** — `owr*`, `opr*`, `chp*`, `excbrk1*`, `addl1*` | Field prefix | Owner=`owr*`, Operator=`opr*`, Chief Pilot=`chp*` |
| `getAcCompanyFractionalReportPaged` | **Flat** — top-level `comp*` and `contact*` fields | `relation` | `"Owner"`, `"Flight Department"`, `"Certificate Holder"` |

### getRegNumber (Flat Schema)

Fields are prefixed at the top level of each relationship object:

```json
{
  "companyrelation": "Owner",
  "companyname": "Acme Aviation LLC",
  "companyid": 4425,
  "contactfirstname": "John",
  "contactlastname": "Doe",
  "contacttitle": "Director of Aviation"
}
```

### getHistoryList / getRelationships (Nested Schema)

Each relationship contains nested `company` and `contact` objects:

```json
{
  "relationtype": "Owner",
  "relationseqno": 1,
  "company": {
    "companyid": 4425,
    "name": "Acme Aviation LLC",
    "address": "123 Main St"
  },
  "contact": {
    "contactid": 747133,
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe"
  }
}
```

### getBulkAircraftExport (Flat Prefixed by Role)

Each role uses a different field prefix:

```json
{
  "owrcompanyname": "Acme Aviation LLC",
  "owrcompanyid": 4425,
  "oprcompanyname": "Flight Ops Inc",
  "oprcompanyid": 5678,
  "chpfirstname": "Mike",
  "chplastname": "Smith"
}
```

| Prefix | Role |
|--------|------|
| `owr*` | Owner |
| `opr*` | Operator |
| `chp*` | Chief Pilot |
| `excbrk1*` / `excbrk2*` | Exclusive Brokers |
| `addl1*` / `addl2*` / `addl3*` | Additional relationships |

### getAcCompanyFractionalReportPaged (Flat)

```json
{
  "relation": "Fractional Owner",
  "companyname": "NetJets Sales Inc",
  "companyid": 12345,
  "fractionPercentOwned": "100.00"
}
```

- `fractionPercentOwned: "100.00"` = actual owner
- `fractionPercentOwned: "0.00"` = operator/manager on same aircraft

## Key Response Keys by Endpoint

| Endpoint | Response Key | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `getRegNumber` | `aircraftresult` | Object |
| `getAircraftList` | `aircraft` | Array |
| `getHistoryListPaged` | `history` | Array |
| `getFlightDataPaged` | `flightdata` | Array |
| `getEventListPaged` | `events` | Array |
| `getRelationships` | `relationships` | Array |
| `getBulkAircraftExport` | `aircraft` | Array |
| `getCondensedOwnerOperators` | `aircraftowneroperators` | Array |
| `getPictures` | `pictures` | Array |

# JETNET Response Shapes -- Normalized Contracts

This document defines three canonical data shapes that normalize JETNET's five raw
response schemas into a consistent interface for UI and pipeline code.

Use these shapes as your application's internal data model. Transform raw JETNET
responses into these shapes at the API boundary -- never spread raw field names
(`owrfname`, `companyrelation`, `contactfirstname`) through your UI components.

---

## Why Normalize?

JETNET returns company/contact data in five different schemas depending on the
endpoint. See the Schema Mapping Quick Reference below for the comparison table.
Normalizing at ingestion means your UI components, CRM mappers, and export jobs
only deal with one shape.

---

## 1. AircraftCard

Canonical aircraft summary. Produced by tail-lookup, aircraft list, and bulk export.

```typescript
interface AircraftCard {

  model: string            // e.g. "G550"
  yearMfr: number
  yearDelivered: number

  // Classification
  makeType: string         // "BusinessJet" | "Turboprop" | "Piston" | ...
  airframeType: string     // "FixedWing" | "Rotorcraft"
  weightClass: string      // "Light" | "Midsize" | "Heavy" | ...
  categorySize: string     // "Light Jet" | "Large Long-Range Jet" | ...

  // Status
  lifecycle: string        // "InOperation" | "Written Off" | ...
  usage: string            // "Business" | "Charter" | ...
  ownership: string        // "Wholly Owned" | "Fractional" | ...
  forSale: boolean
  askingPrice: string | null  // "Inquire" or dollar string or null
  marketStatus: string | null

  // Home base
  baseIcao: string | null
  baseAirport: string | null
  baseCountry: string | null
  baseContinent: string | null

  // Airframe metrics
  estimatedAFTT: number | null
  estimatedCycles: number | null
  estimatedFlightHours: number | null

  // Relationships (normalized -- see CompanyCard below)
  owner: CompanyCard | null

## 3. GoldenPathResult

The "golden path" shape: everything a front-end component or CRM trigger needs in
one flat dict. Produced by combining AircraftCard + ownership history + market data.
Designed for the Next.js tail-lookup template and CRM enrichment pipelines.

```typescript
interface GoldenPathResult {
  // Aircraft identity (from AircraftCard)
  aircraftId: number
  tailNumber: string
  make: string
  model: string
  yearMfr: number
  yearDelivered: number
  categorySize: string
  weightClass: string

  // Market status
  forSale: boolean
  askingPrice: string | null
  marketStatus: string | null

  // Current owner + operator (from AircraftCard)
  owner: CompanyCard | null
  operator: CompanyCard | null
  chiefPilot: ContactCard | null

  // Home base
  baseIcao: string | null
  baseAirport: string | null
  baseCountry: string | null

  // Enrichment metadata
  jetnetPageUrl: string | null    // link to JETNET Evolution detail page
  lastUpdated: string | null      // ISO datetime of last JETNET update
  dataSource: string              // always "JETNET"

# JETNET ID System

## The Core Principle

JETNET uses several distinct ID systems. None of them are the same thing. The most common mistake is confusing `regnbr` (the tail number humans use) with `aircraftid` (the integer the API uses). Once you have `aircraftid`, almost everything else follows from it.

## Quick Reference

| Goal | ID to Use |
|------|-----------|
| Look up an aircraft by tail number | `regnbr` (input to `getRegNumber`) |
| Call any aircraft sub-record endpoint | `aircraftid` |
| Filter a list by aircraft type | `modelid` (in `modlist`) |
| Filter a list to specific aircraft | `aircraftid` (in `aclist`) |
| Pull a company's full record or contacts | `companyid` |
| Cross-reference with manufacturer records | `serialnbr` |
| Deduplicate history sync records | `transid` |
| Geographic analysis and territory maps | `baseicao` |
| Store as permanent external key in your database | `aircraftid` (not `regnbr`) |

## Aircraft Identifiers

### `aircraftid` (integer)

JETNET's internal primary key for an aircraft. Every aircraft in the database has a unique `aircraftid` that never changes even if the registration number changes.

**Where you get it:** From `getRegNumber`, `getAircraftList`, `getBulkAircraftExport`, or any history/event record.

**When to use it:** As the join key for all sub-record calls — pictures, relationships, flight data, history. This is the ID to store if you are building a database or CRM integration.

**Example:** `144322`

### `regnbr` (string)

The registration number (tail number) — the human-readable identifier printed on the aircraft. In the US this is typically `N` followed by numbers and letters (e.g., `N131SF`). International registrations follow country-specific formats.

**Where you get it:** User input, or any aircraft record.

**When to use it:** As input to `getRegNumber` for a tail lookup. Do not use `regnbr` as a database primary key — it can change when an aircraft is re-registered. `aircraftid` is stable; `regnbr` is not.

**Example:** `"N131SF"`, `"G-XBEK"`, `"VH-NSX"`

### `serialnbr` (string)

The manufacturer's serial number (MSN). This is the number stamped on the airframe at the factory and never changes.

**Where you get it:** Any aircraft record — `getRegNumber`, `getAircraft`, `getAircraftList`.

**When to use it:** Cross-referencing with manufacturer records, logbooks, or export certificates. If you need a permanent external identifier that predates JETNET, this is it.

**Example:** `"UC-131"`, `"2192"`, `"20564"`

### `modelid` (integer)

JETNET's internal ID for a specific aircraft model (make + model combination). The Gulfstream G550 has one `modelid`; the Gulfstream G600 has a different one.

**Where you get it:** From any aircraft record, or from `getAircraftModelList` which returns a full list of models with their IDs for a given make.

**When to use it:** As input to `modlist` in any list, history, or flight endpoint when you want to filter by aircraft type.

**Example:** `145` (G550), `634` (G600), `1188` (Challenger 350)

### `icaotype` (string)

The four-character ICAO aircraft type designator. Used in flight planning systems and ATC.

**Where you get it:** Aircraft records — `getRegNumber`, `getAircraft`.

**When to use it:** Cross-referencing with flight tracking systems, ADS-B data, or ICAO databases. Not used as a JETNET filter parameter.

**Example:** `"GLF5"` (Gulfstream V/G550), `"A319"` (Airbus A319/ACJ319)

## Company Identifiers

### `companyid` (integer)

JETNET's internal primary key for a company (legal entity). Owners, operators, manufacturers, and fractional providers all have `companyid` values.

**Where you get it:** From any relationship record — `getRelationships`, `getHistoryList`, `getRegNumber` companyrelationships, `getCompanyList`.

**When to use it:** As input to company sub-record endpoints: `getCompany/{companyid}`, `getContacts/{companyid}`, `getRelatedcompanies/{companyid}`, `getAircraftrelationships/{companyid}`.

**Example:** `4425`, `350427`

### `parentcompanyid` (integer)

The `companyid` of the parent company if the company is a subsidiary. Zero (`0`) means no parent — the company is a standalone entity.

**Where you get it:** Company records and nested `company` objects in relationship arrays.

**When to use it:** Building corporate hierarchy trees, identifying subsidiaries for fleet analysis, or understanding if an "operator" is actually a wholly owned subsidiary of the named owner.

## Contact Identifiers

### `contactid` (integer)

JETNET's internal primary key for an individual person.

**Where you get it:** From relationship records in `getRelationships`, `getHistoryList`, and `getRegNumber` companyrelationships.

**When to use it:** As input to `getContact/{contactid}/{apiToken}` to pull the full contact record. Also used to de-duplicate contacts across multiple aircraft or company records.

**Example:** `747133`, `524808`

## Airport and Geography Identifiers

### `baseicao` / `icao` (string)

The four-character ICAO airport code for the aircraft's home base. More precise than IATA codes and the preferred identifier for aviation data systems.

**Where you get it:** Aircraft records (`baseicao`), flight records (`origin`, `destination`).

**When to use it:** For geographic analysis, territory mapping, and filtering. Use `getAirportList` to get a full airport list with ICAO codes and coordinates.

**Example:** `"KOMA"` (Omaha Eppley), `"KTEB"` (Teterboro), `"LLBG"` (Tel Aviv Ben Gurion)

### `baseiata` / `iata` (string)

The three-character IATA airport code. More familiar to non-aviation audiences but less precise than ICAO (some airports have ICAO but no IATA).

**Where you get it:** Aircraft records and flight records.

**When to use it:** When displaying to end users who expect airline-style codes. Prefer ICAO for data joins.

**Example:** `"OMA"`, `"TEB"`, `"TLV"`

## Transaction and Event Identifiers

### `transid` (integer)

The unique ID for a specific history transaction record. Every ownership change, sale, or update event has a `transid`.

**Where you get it:** From `getHistoryList` records.

**When to use it:** For deduplication when building incremental sync pipelines. The JETNET transaction detail URL also uses `transid`:

```
http://www.jetnetevolution.com/DisplayAircraftDetail.aspx?acid={aircraftid}&jid={transid}
```

# JETNET Bulk Export Integration

## Endpoint

`POST /api/Aircraft/getBulkAircraftExportPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}`

The bulk export endpoint is not a simple aircraft query -- it is a **data graph engine**. Each execution builds a relational dataset including aircraft, companies, contacts, phones, events, and flight summaries. Entity counts scale nonlinearly with aircraft count because joins are automatically expanded.

---

## Two Operating Modes

### Snapshot Mode

Omit `aircraftchanges` or leave it blank. Returns a full dataset snapshot matching your filters.

```json
{
  "modlist": [278, 288],
  "maketype": "None",
  "airframetype": "None",
  "forsale": "",
  "actiondate": "",
  "enddate": "",
  "aclist": []
}
```

Use snapshot mode for:
- Initial full data ingestion
- Periodic full refreshes
- One-time exports

### Delta Mode

Set `aircraftchanges` to `true`. Returns aircraft with qualifying changes **since your last API call**. The JETNET backend tracks when you last pulled data and returns only records that changed after that point.

Use `actiondate` / `enddate` as additional date-range filters on the result set, but `aircraftchanges=true` itself means "since last call" -- not "since `actiondate`."

```json
{
  "modlist": [278, 288],
  "maketype": "None",
  "airframetype": "None",
  "forsale": "",
  "actiondate": "02/26/2026 10:00:00",
  "enddate": "02/27/2026 10:00:00",
  "aircraftchanges": true,
  "aclist": []
}
```

Delta mode still returns **full records**, not field-level diffs. When an aircraft qualifies, you get the entire relational graph for that aircraft -- not just the fields that changed.

---

## Graph-Based Change Detection

An aircraft qualifies for inclusion in a delta pull if **any related entity** changes -- not just the aircraft record itself.

Changes that trigger inclusion:

| Entity | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Aircraft record | Tail number change, lifecycle update |
| Ownership | New owner, operator change |
| Company relationships | Company name change, address update |
| Contacts | New chief pilot, contact info update |
| Events | Maintenance event, inspection |
| Flight activity | New flight records |

This is graph-level change detection. A contact phone number change on the owner company will cause the aircraft to appear in the delta, even though nothing about the aircraft itself changed.

---

## actiondate / enddate as Date-Range Filters

When using delta mode, `aircraftchanges=true` determines the change window (since last call). The `actiondate` and `enddate` fields act as **additional date-range filters** on the result set, not as the change cursor itself:

- **`actiondate`** -- lower bound of the date filter window
- **`enddate`** -- upper bound of the date filter window
- **Empty values** -- no date-range restriction (returns all qualifying changes since last call)

The JETNET backend automatically tracks your last call, so you do not need to manage a watermark yourself. Simply call with `aircraftchanges=true` on a regular schedule:

```python
body = {
    "modlist": [278, 288],
    "aircraftchanges": True,
    "actiondate": "",
    "enddate": "",
    "aclist": [],
    "maketype": "None",
    "airframetype": "None",
    "forsale": ""
}

results = get_all_pages(bearer, token, path, body)
```

Use `actiondate` / `enddate` when you need to narrow the date range further (e.g., hourly polling windows with `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS` format).

---

## Entity Scaling

Each aircraft record expands into related entities. A query returning 100 aircraft does not mean 100 flat records -- it means 100 aircraft plus their full relationship graphs:

```
Aircraft
 ├── Owner company + contacts + phones
 ├── Operator company + contacts + phones
 ├── Chief pilot contact
 ├── Exclusive brokers (up to 2) + contacts
 ├── Additional relationships (up to 3)
 ├── Events
 └── Flight summary
```

A fleet of 100 aircraft could produce thousands of related entity records. Always use `modlist` or `aclist` to bound your scope.

---

## Correct Integration Pattern

### Step 1: Initial Snapshot

Run a full snapshot export to populate your local store.

```python
body = {
    "modlist": TARGET_MODELS,
    "maketype": "None",
    "airframetype": "None",
    "forsale": "",
    "actiondate": "",
    "enddate": "",
    "aclist": []
}
all_aircraft = get_all_pages(bearer, token, bulk_path, body)
upsert_all(all_aircraft)
```

### Step 2: Periodic Delta Pulls

Run delta pulls on a schedule (hourly, daily) using `aircraftchanges=true`. The backend tracks your last call automatically -- you don't need to manage a watermark. Optionally use `actiondate` / `enddate` to narrow the date range.

### Step 3: Upsert Entire Records

Delta mode returns complete records, not patches. Always **upsert the entire aircraft record** rather than trying to diff individual fields:

```python
for aircraft in delta_results:
    db.upsert(
        table="aircraft",
        key={"aircraft_id": aircraft["aircraftid"]},
        data=normalize(aircraft)
    )
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Using bulk export for UI search | Exports are synchronous and built inline -- too slow for live dashboards | Use `getRegNumber` or `getAircraftList` for interactive queries |
| No scope filters | Unbounded `modlist: []` + `aclist: []` creates massive payloads | Always filter by `modlist`, `aclist`, or `maketype` |
| Mixing test/production tokens | Authentication failures with no clear error | Use separate environment variables for each environment |
| Patching individual fields from delta | Delta returns full records, not diffs | Upsert the entire record |
| Expecting field-level change info | Delta tells you *which aircraft changed*, not *what changed* | Compare against your stored copy if you need change details |

---

## Response Format

The bulk export uses a **flat prefixed schema** for relationships. See [Response Handling](response-handling.md) for the full schema comparison.

| Prefix | Role |
|--------|------|
| `owr*` | Owner |
| `opr*` | Operator |
| `chp*` | Chief Pilot |
| `excbrk1*` / `excbrk2*` | Exclusive Brokers |
| `addl1*` / `addl2*` / `addl3*` | Additional relationships |

Other bulk export quirks:
- `forsale` is `"Y"` / `"N"` (not `"true"` / `"false"`)
- `datepurchased` is `YYYYMMDD` format (not `MM/DD/YYYY`)
- `maxpages: 0` means single page -- use `max(maxpages, 1)` in your loop
- `actiondate` accepts `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS` for hourly polling windows

See [Common Mistakes](common-mistakes.md) and [Pagination](pagination.md) for details on these quirks.

# JETNET Aircraft History Endpoints

## Conceptual Model

History endpoints return **transaction events**, not aircraft state. Each record represents a discrete ownership or leasing event -- a sale, lease, transfer, or relationship change.

```
Aircraft Timeline = Ordered Set of Transactions

2019-03  Full Sale — Company A → Company B
2021-07  Lease — Company B → Company C
2024-01  Full Sale — Company C → Company D
```

This is fundamentally different from other endpoint types:

| Endpoint Type | What It Returns | Use Case |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Aircraft / Bulk Export | Current state | "Who owns this now?" |
| Snapshot | State at a historical date | "Who owned this in 2016?" |
| History | Change events over time | "When was this sold? To whom?" |
| Flight Data | Operational activity | "How many hours did it fly?" |

---

## Endpoints

### Aircraft History

```
POST /api/Aircraft/getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
```

Returns transaction records filtered by aircraft attributes, model, company, and transaction type.

### Company History

```
POST /api/Company/getCompanyHistoryPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
```

Returns transaction history for a specific company. Use when the question is "What aircraft has this company bought/sold?" rather than "What happened to this aircraft?"

---

## Request Structure

```json
{
  "aircraftid": 0,
  "airframetype": "None",
  "maketype": "None",
  "make": "",
  "modelid": 0,
  "modlist": [1194],
  "aclist": [],
  "companyid": 0,
  "isnewaircraft": "No",
  "isinternaltrans": "No",
  "allrelationships": true,
  "transtype": ["FullSale", "Lease"],
  "startdate": "08/22/2025",
  "enddate": "02/18/2026"
}
```

### Filter Parameters

**Aircraft identification:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `aircraftid` | Single aircraft lookup (0 = no filter) |
| `make` | Manufacturer filter (case-insensitive) |
| `modelid` | Single model ID |
| `modlist` | Array of model IDs for multi-model queries |
| `aclist` | Array of aircraft IDs |
| `airframetype` | `"FixedWing"`, `"Rotorcraft"`, `"None"` |
| `maketype` | `"BusinessJet"`, `"Turboprop"`, `"None"` |

**Transaction filters:**

| Field | Purpose | Values |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `transtype` | Transaction categories | `["None"]` (all), `["FullSale"]`, `["Lease"]`, `["InternalSale"]`, `["Management"]`, `["Insurance"]`, `["Repossession"]`, `["Registration"]` |
| `isnewaircraft` | Include factory-new deliveries | `"Yes"`, `"No"`, `"Ignore"` |
| `isinternaltrans` | Include intra-company transfers | `"Yes"`, `"No"`, `"Ignore"` |
| `allrelationships` | Return all parties (Seller, Purchaser, Brokers) | `true` / `false` |

**Company / relationship:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `companyid` | History tied to a specific company (0 = no filter) |
| `allrelationships` | Include all ownership/operator relationships |

**Date range:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `startdate` | Beginning of history window (`MM/DD/YYYY`) |
| `enddate` | End of history window (`MM/DD/YYYY`) |

Date filtering is critical for performance. Always provide a bounded date range.

## Response Structure

Response key: **`history`** (array)

```json
{
  "responseid": "556111434",

      "actiondate": "2025-09-04T15:09:33",
      "translastactiondate": "2025-09-04T15:09:33",
      "description": "Sold from AMW Aero to Awaiting Documentation",
      "internaltrans": false,
      "newac": "preowned",
      "transretail": true,
      "soldprice": null,
      "askingprice": null,
      "listdate": "2025-04-10T00:00:00",
      "purchasedate": "2025-01-16T00:00:00",
      "usage": "Charter",

      "basecountry": "France",
      "basecontinent": "Europe",
      "estaftt": 76,
      "estcycles": 17,
      "companyrelationships": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Response Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `transid` | Unique transaction identifier |
| `transtype` | Descriptive transaction string (not the request category) |
| `transdate` | Actual transaction date (ISO) |
| `actiondate` | When JETNET last updated this record (ISO) |
| `translastactiondate` | Last action timestamp on this transaction |
| `description` | Human-readable transaction summary |
| `soldprice` / `askingprice` | Often `null` -- many deals are confidential |
| `transretail` | `true` = arm's length retail transaction (use for comparable sales) |
| `internaltrans` | `false` = not an intra-company transfer |
| `newac` | `"preowned"` or `"new"` |
| `listdate` | When aircraft was listed for sale |
| `purchasedate` | When it entered current owner's fleet |
| `pageurl` | Deep link to JETNET Evolution web detail page |

**Important:** `transtype` values in the **request** are categories (`"FullSale"`), but values in the **response** are descriptive strings (`"Full Sale - Retail to Retail"`, `"Full Sale - Retail to Leasing Company"`, etc.). See [Enum Reference](enum-reference.md) for known values.

### Company Relationships (Nested Schema)

History uses the **nested relationship schema** -- same as `getRelationships`. Each entry contains `company: {}` and `contact: {}` sub-objects with a `relationtype` field.

```json
{
  "companyid": 422540,
  "name": "AMW Aero",
  "relationtype": "Seller",
  "company": {
    "companyid": 422540,
    "name": "AMW Aero",
    "address1": "11 Route d Archigny",
    "city": "Sainte-Radegonde",
    "country": "France",
    "email": "Sales02@acimetechnology.fr"
  },
  "contact": {
    "contactid": 606048,
    "firstname": "Herve",
    "lastname": "Mouly",
    "title": "Manager",
    "email": "herve@amwaero.com"
  }
}
```

History-specific `relationtype` values: `"Seller"`, `"Purchaser"`, `"Operator"`, `"Seller's Broker"`, `"Purchaser's Broker"`.

See [Response Handling](response-handling.md) for the full nested vs flat schema comparison.

---

## History Records Are Event Pointers

History records include aircraft summary fields (make, model, tail, serial) but they are primarily **transaction records**. For full current aircraft state, enrich with other endpoints:

| Need | Endpoint |
|------|----------|
| Current ownership / operator details | `getRelationships` |
| Full aircraft detail | `getAircraftList` or `getRegNumber` |
| Company detail | `getCompany` |
| Flight activity | `getFlightDataPaged` |

### Enrichment Pattern

```python
history = get_all_pages(bearer, token, history_path, history_body)

for record in sorted(history, key=lambda r: r["transdate"]):
    aircraft_id = record["aircraftid"]
    
    relationships = api_post(
        f"/api/Aircraft/getRelationships/{token}",
        {"aclist": [aircraft_id], "modlist": []}
    )
```

---

## Use Cases

### Ownership Timeline

Query a single aircraft's full transaction history to build a chronological ownership chain:

```json
{
  "aircraftid": 125375,
  "transtype": ["None"],
  "startdate": "01/01/2010",
  "enddate": "02/28/2026",
  "allrelationships": true,
  "isinternaltrans": "Ignore",
  "isnewaircraft": "Ignore"
}
```

Sort results by `transdate ASC` to produce a timeline.

### Comparable Sales Analysis

Find all retail pre-owned sales for a model in a date window:

```json
{
  "modlist": [1194],
  "transtype": ["FullSale"],
  "isnewaircraft": "No",
  "isinternaltrans": "No",
  "allrelationships": true,
  "startdate": "01/01/2025",
  "enddate": "02/28/2026"
}
```

Filter results where `transretail: true` for arm's length transactions.

### Leasing Intelligence

Track lease activity for a model segment:

```json
{
  "modlist": [278, 288, 663],
  "transtype": ["Lease"],
  "startdate": "01/01/2025",
  "enddate": "02/28/2026",
  "allrelationships": true
}
```

### Change Detection Alerts

Poll periodically with a narrow date window to detect new transactions:

```json
{
  "modlist": [278],
  "transtype": ["None"],
  "startdate": "02/27/2026",
  "enddate": "02/28/2026",
  "allrelationships": true
}
```

---

## Performance Notes

- Always provide `startdate` / `enddate` to bound the query
- Use `modelid`, `modlist`, or `companyid` to limit scope
- High-activity models (e.g., King Air, Citation CJ series) produce dense result sets
- `maxpages: 0` / `currentpage: 0` means all results fit in one response -- not an error. See [Pagination](pagination.md) for the `max(maxpages, 1)` pattern.

# JETNET Aircraft Snapshot Endpoint

## Conceptual Model

The snapshot endpoint provides a **frozen view of aircraft ownership and operator state at a specific historical date**. Unlike history endpoints (which return transaction events) or live queries (which return current state), snapshots answer:

> "Who owned or operated this aircraft on May 1, 2016?"

Think of it as a database time machine for fleet composition.

```
Aircraft Timeline
------------------------------
2014  Owner A
2016  Owner B
2019  Owner C

Snapshot(2016) → Owner B
History        → [A→B→C transitions]
Current        → Owner C
```

| Endpoint Type | Returns | Analogy |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Aircraft / Bulk Export | Current state | "NOW" |
| Snapshot | State at a historical date | "THEN" |
| History | Change events over time | "WHAT CHANGED" |
| Flight Data | Operational activity | "WHAT HAPPENED" |

---

## Endpoint

```
POST /api/Aircraft/getCondensedSnapshot/{apiToken}
```

Returns condensed aircraft ownership/operator records as they existed on the requested `snapshotdate`.

**Important:** This endpoint is **non-paged**. It returns the full dataset in a single response, which can be multi-MB for broad queries.

---

## Request Structure

```json
{
  "airframetype": "None",
  "maketype": "None",
  "sernbr": "",
  "regnbr": "",
  "modelid": 0,

  "basecountry": "Mexico",
  "snapshotdate": "05/01/2016",
  "yearmfr": 0,
  "yeardlv": 0,
  "aclist": [],
  "modlist": [],
  "exactMatchReg": false
}
```

### Parameters

**Temporal control (required):**

| Field | Purpose | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `snapshotdate` | Historical reference date | `MM/DD/YYYY` |

This is the defining parameter. Everything returned reflects the fleet as it existed on this date.

**Aircraft filters:**

|-------|---------|
| `make` | Manufacturer filter (case-insensitive) |
| `modelid` | Single model ID (0 = no filter) |
| `modlist` | Array of model IDs |
| `aclist` | Array of aircraft IDs |
| `sernbr` | Serial number filter |
| `regnbr` | Registration / tail number filter |
| `exactMatchReg` | `true` for exact match, `false` for partial |
| `airframetype` | `"FixedWing"`, `"Rotorcraft"`, `"None"` |
| `maketype` | `"BusinessJet"`, `"Turboprop"`, `"Piston"`, `"None"` |

**Operational filters:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `lifecycle` | Aircraft operational state (`"InOperation"`, `"None"`) |
| `basecountry` | Country where aircraft was based |
| `basestate` | State/region filter (array) |
| `yearmfr` | Manufacturing year (0 = no filter) |
| `yeardlv` | Delivery year (0 = no filter) |

---

## Response Structure

Response key: **`snapshotowneroperators`** (array)

```json
{
  "responseid": "...",
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "count": 2651,
  "snapshotowneroperators": [
    {
      "snapshotdate": "5/2016",
      "acid": 610,
      "airframetype": "FixedWing",
      "maketype": "Piston",
      "make": "BARON",
      "model": "58"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each record represents an aircraft + ownership/operator relationship as it existed at the snapshot date.

---

## Performance and Payload Size

Snapshot responses can be large:
- A country-level query (e.g., all aircraft based in Mexico) can return thousands of records and multi-MB payloads
- There is **no pagination** -- the full dataset comes in one response

**Always filter** to keep payloads manageable:

| Filter | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `modlist` | Scope to specific models -- most effective |
| `basecountry` | Limit to a single country |
| `maketype` | Limit to a category (BusinessJet, Turboprop) |
| `lifecycle` | Exclude scrapped/stored aircraft |
| `aclist` | Query specific aircraft only |

Avoid unrestricted global snapshot pulls. A query with no filters against a broad `snapshotdate` produces very large payloads.

---

## Use Cases

### Historical Fleet Composition

"How many G550s were based in the US in 2018?"

```json
{
  "modlist": [278],
  "basecountry": "United States",
  "snapshotdate": "12/31/2018",
  "lifecycle": "InOperation"
}
```

Count the results to get fleet size at that date.

### "Who Owned This in Year X?"

```json
{
  "aclist": [125375],
  "snapshotdate": "06/15/2020"
}
```

### Market Comparison Across Years

Run the same filtered query with different `snapshotdate` values to compare fleet composition over time:

```python
years = ["12/31/2018", "12/31/2020", "12/31/2022", "12/31/2024"]
fleet_sizes = {}

for date in years:
    body = {
        "modlist": [278],
        "basecountry": "United States",
        "snapshotdate": date,
        "lifecycle": "InOperation",
        "airframetype": "None",
        "maketype": "None",
        "make": "",
        "modelid": 0,
        "sernbr": "",
        "regnbr": "",
        "yearmfr": 0,
        "yeardlv": 0,
        "aclist": [],
        "exactMatchReg": False
    }
    result = api_post(f"/api/Aircraft/getCondensedSnapshot/{token}", body)
    fleet_sizes[date] = result["count"]
```

### Country Fleet Growth Analysis

Compare aircraft counts by country across snapshot dates to identify growing or shrinking markets.

---

## Engineering Recommendations

**Caching:** Snapshot data is historical and immutable -- cache aggressively. A snapshot for `05/01/2016` will always return the same data.

**Pre-aggregation:** For dashboards or recurring analytics, pre-aggregate common snapshot dates into summary tables rather than calling the API repeatedly.

**Backend summarization:** Avoid feeding raw multi-MB snapshot payloads directly into conversational AI or LLM prompts. Summarize or aggregate on your backend first.

```

# Market Trends & Time-Series Analytics

The JETNET API exposes multiple endpoints that, when combined, form a complete longitudinal dataset for aviation market intelligence. This guide explains how to layer them into time-series analytics.

---

## Data Layers

| Layer | Endpoint | What It Provides |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Market** | `getModelMarketTrends` | Monthly pricing, inventory, days-on-market per model |
| **State** | `getCondensedSnapshot` | Fleet ownership/operator state at a historical date |
| **Causal** | `getEventListPaged` | Discrete lifecycle changes explaining why state changed |
| **Activity** | `getFlightData` / `getFlights` | Flight hours, routes, utilization |
| **Transaction** | `getHistoryListPaged` | Sales, leases, ownership transfers |
| **Current** | `getCondensedOwnerOperators` | Current ownership/operator relationships |

Unified by: **model ID**, **aircraft ID**, and **date**.

---

## 1. Model Market Trends (Core Time Series)

`POST /api/Model/getModelMarketTrends/{apiToken}`

}
```

### Derived Metrics

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **Supply Pressure** | `aircraft_for_sale_count / in_operation_count` |
| **Liquidity Score** | Inverse of `avg_daysonmarket` trend slope |
| **Price Trend Index** | MoM change in `avg_asking_price` |
| **Market Heat** | Supply Pressure inverted -- low supply + high utilization = hot market |
| **Inventory Velocity** | Rate of change in `aircraft_for_sale_count` |

---

## 2. Fleet Snapshot Trends (Historical State)

`POST /api/Aircraft/getCondensedSnapshot/{apiToken}`

Query the same filters across multiple `snapshotdate` values to build fleet composition curves over time. See [Snapshots](snapshots.md) for full endpoint documentation.

### Time-Series Construction

```python
dates = ["12/31/2018", "12/31/2019", "12/31/2020", "12/31/2021",
         "12/31/2022", "12/31/2023", "12/31/2024"]

for date in dates:
    body["snapshotdate"] = date
    result = api_post(f"/api/Aircraft/getCondensedSnapshot/{token}", body)
    store_snapshot(date, result["count"], result["snapshotowneroperators"])
```

### Derived Metrics

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|--------------|
| Net fleet change by region | Geographic migration trends |
| Ownership turnover rate | Market liquidity signal |
| Manufacturer market penetration | Competitive landscape |
| Active vs inactive fleet ratio | Lifecycle health |

Snapshots are the **baseline state layer** that contextualizes market trend movements.

---

## 3. Flight Activity Trends

`POST /api/Aircraft/getFlightDataPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}` (per-flight)
`GET /api/Aircraft/getFlights/{aircraftId}/{apiToken}` (monthly summary)

See [Flight Data](flight-data.md) for full endpoint documentation.

### Trend Metrics

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Flight hours trend | Monthly `flighthours` from `getFlights` |
| Utilization per model | Aggregate `flighthours / fleet_count` |
| Route patterns | Origin/destination from `getFlightData` |
| Fuel/emissions trends | `estfuelburn` / `estCO2emissions` from `getFlightData` |

### Correlation Signals

| Pattern | Signal |
|---------|--------|
| Rising utilization + declining inventory | Tightening market |
| Falling utilization + growing inventory | Market softening |
| Stable utilization + rising prices | Demand-driven pricing |

---

## 4. Transaction Trends

`POST /api/Aircraft/getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}`

See [History](history.md) for full endpoint documentation.

### Trend Metrics

| Metric | How To Compute |

| Turnover velocity | Time between `purchasedate` and next `transdate` for same aircraft |
| Regional acquisition waves | Group by `basecountry` / `basecontinent` over time |

Filter with `transretail: true` for arm's length transactions when building comparable sales trends.

---

## 5. Owner/Operator Movement Trends

`POST /api/Aircraft/getCondensedOwnerOperators/{apiToken}`

Returns current ownership/operator relationships. When captured periodically, enables:

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|--------------|
| Operator fleet expansion/contraction | Growth signals |
| Corporate fleet migration | Market movement |
| Charter vs private ownership shifts | Segment trends |
| New entrant detection | Companies appearing for the first time |

Response key: `aircraftowneroperators`

---

## Composite Indicators

By combining data across layers, build higher-value analytics:

### Market Momentum Index

```
(Monthly Transaction Volume + Flight Utilization Change) / Inventory Growth
```

High momentum = active, tightening market. Low or negative = cooling.

### Supply Pressure Index

```
Aircraft For Sale / In Operation Fleet
```

From `getModelMarketTrends`. Track monthly for supply curve direction.

### Utilization vs Pricing Correlation

Plot `avg_airframe_time` trends against `avg_asking_price` from market trends. Divergence signals mispricing.

# JETNET Aircraft Events

## Conceptual Model

Events are **discrete, timestamped records of real-world changes** to aircraft -- ownership transfers, for-sale listings, accidents, maintenance milestones, and lifecycle transitions. They represent the **atomic causal layer** of the JETNET dataset.

Where other endpoints describe *what* the market looks like (snapshots), *how* it's trending (market trends), or *what activity occurred* (flights), events explain **why things changed**.

```
EVENTS  →  SNAPSHOTS  →  TRENDS
(raw)      (state)       (analytics)
```

| Layer | Endpoint | Time Meaning |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Atomic Events | `getEventListPaged` | Individual real-world changes |
| Snapshot | `getCondensedSnapshot` | Market state at a point in time |
| Aggregated Trends | `getModelMarketTrends` | Derived market metrics over time |
| Transaction History | `getHistoryListPaged` | Ownership/leasing transactions |
| Flight Activity | `getFlightDataPaged` | Operational movements |

Events are the **ground truth** that snapshots and trends are built from.

---

## Endpoint

```
POST /api/Aircraft/getEventListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
```

Returns aircraft event records filtered by event category, event type, date range, model, and aircraft list.

---

## Request Structure

```json
{
  "evcategory": ["transaction"],
  "evtype": ["Off Market Due To Sale"],
  "startdate": "01/25/2026",
  "enddate": "02/02/2026",
  "aclist": [],
  "modlist": [],
  "aircraftid": 0,
  "modelid": 0,
  "make": ""
}
```

### Parameters

| Field | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `evcategory` | Event category filter | Array of strings. Use `[]` for all categories. |
| `evtype` | Event type filter | Array of strings. Use `[]` for all types. |
| `startdate` | Start of event window | `MM/DD/YYYY` with leading zeros |
| `enddate` | End of event window | `MM/DD/YYYY` with leading zeros |
| `aclist` | Aircraft ID filter | Array of aircraft IDs. `[]` = no filter. |
| `modlist` | Model ID filter | Array of model IDs. `[]` = no filter. |
| `aircraftid` | Single aircraft lookup | `0` = no filter |
| `modelid` | Single model filter | `0` = no filter |
| `make` | Manufacturer filter | Case-insensitive. `""` = no filter. |

### Event Categories and Event Types

Events are classified into **categories** (domain groupings) and **types** (specific change signals). These turn events from a raw stream into typed, actionable intelligence.

**Known event categories:**

| Category | Covers |
|----------|--------|
| Aircraft Information | Base changes, airframe hours, registration, specs |
| Company / Contact | Ownership, operator, contact updates |
| Financial Documents | Financial record changes |
| Market Status | For-sale listings, off-market, status transitions |
| Transaction | Sales, leases, ownership transfers |

**Example event types** (within categories):

- Change in Aircraft Base
- Change in Airframe Total Time
- Ownership Transfer
- For Sale / Off Market
- Operator Change
- Registration Change

To discover all valid values, call the utility endpoints:

```
GET  /api/Utility/getEventCategories/{apiToken}
POST /api/Utility/getEventTypes/{apiToken}  body: { "eventcategory": "Transaction" }
```

`getEventTypes` accepts a single `eventcategory` string and returns the valid types within that category.

### Enum Values Are Strict

`evcategory` and `evtype` values must match exactly. Sending unrecognized values returns an error inside `responsestatus` even when HTTP status is 200.

**Safe default:** Use `[]` for both `evcategory` and `evtype` to return all event types without guessing enum strings. Always call the utility endpoints above to discover valid values before filtering.

---

## Response Structure

Response key: **`events`** (array)

```json
{
  "responseid": "340652808",
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "count": 961,
  "currentpage": 0,
  "maxpages": 0,
  "events": [
    {
      "aircraftid": 232064,
      "make": "ROBINSON",
      "model": "R44 RAVEN II",
      "sernbr": "14343",
      "regnbr": "VH-NSX",
      "yearmfr": 2019,
      "yeardlv": 2019,
      "date": "2025-04-14T05:48:33",
      "subject": "New Owner",
      "description": "AirX, Inc."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `aircraftid` | Aircraft reference ID |
| `make` / `model` | Manufacturer and model |
| `sernbr` | Serial number |
| `regnbr` | Registration / tail number |
| `yearmfr` / `yeardlv` | Year manufactured / delivered |
| `date` | Event timestamp (ISO format) |
| `subject` | Event subject / headline |
| `description` | Event detail |

---

## Events as the Causal Layer

Events explain the **why** behind changes visible in other datasets:

| Observation in Trends/Snapshots | Events Explanation |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| Inventory spike for a model | Cluster of for-sale listing events |
| Price drop in market trends | Dealer acquisition events increasing supply |
| Operator count change in snapshots | Ownership transfer events |
| Fleet size decline | Retirement or export events |

---

## Use Cases

### Lifecycle Timeline per Aircraft

Query all events for a single aircraft to reconstruct its full lifecycle:

```json
{
  "aircraftid": 232064,
  "evcategory": [],
  "evtype": [],
  "startdate": "01/01/2010",
  "enddate": "02/28/2026"
}
```

Sort by `date ASC` to produce a timeline:

```
Delivery → Operator Change → Lease → For Sale → Sale → New Owner → Export
```

### Market Velocity Measurement

Count events per model per month to measure transaction frequency:

```json
{
  "modlist": [278, 288, 663],
  "evcategory": ["transaction"],
  "evtype": [],
  "startdate": "01/01/2025",
  "enddate": "02/28/2026"
}
```

High event density = active trading. Low density = sticky ownership.

### Pre-Listing Detection

Look for patterns that predict aircraft entering the market:

```
Operator change → Maintenance event → For-sale listing
```

Query broad event categories and filter for sequences that precede listings.

### Ownership Churn Index

```
Owner change events per model / in-operation fleet count = churn rate
```

Combine with `getModelMarketTrends` (for fleet count) to compute. High churn indicates an unstable or liquidating market segment.

### Event-Driven Alerts

Poll events on a schedule (hourly or daily) with a narrow date window to detect new activity:

```json
{
  "modlist": [278],
  "evcategory": [],
  "evtype": [],
  "startdate": "02/27/2026",
  "enddate": "02/28/2026"
}
```

---

## Event Importance and Signal Priority

Not all events carry equal weight. Classify events by category to drive notifications, dashboards, and scoring:

| Priority | Categories | Signal Value |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **High** | Transaction, Market Status | Ownership transfers, for-sale/off-market transitions -- immediate market intelligence |
| **Medium** | Aircraft Information | Base changes, hours updates, registration changes -- operational context |
| **Low** | Financial Documents, Company / Contact | Record-keeping updates -- background enrichment |

Use this classification to:
- Filter alert subscriptions (only notify on high-priority events)
- Build "What Changed Today" dashboards sorted by importance
- Drive scoring models (high-priority events weighted more heavily)
- Generate automated market intelligence summaries

### Events as a Signal Engine

Events are most valuable when treated as **actionable signals**, not a historical log:

```
CJ3+ changed base to KTEB    → notify regional broker
G550 listed for sale          → trigger opportunity alert
Ownership transfer on G200    → update company intelligence
Airframe hours milestone      → flag upcoming maintenance
```

---

## Derived Metrics

| Metric | How To Compute |
|--------|---------------|
| **Events per Aircraft (90-day rolling)** | Count events per `aircraftid` in trailing 90-day window |
| **Transfer-to-Listing Conversion Rate** | Ownership transfer events followed by for-sale listing / total transfers |
| **Operator Change Frequency** | Operator change events per model per year |
| **Average Time Between Events** | Mean gap between consecutive events per aircraft |
| **Regional Movement Index** | Registration change events grouped by country |

---

## Events in the Analytics Stack

Events complete the four-layer analytics architecture:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Analytics Output            │
│  Dashboards, Alerts, Predictions     │

   getModel  getCond   getEvent getFlight
   Market    ensed     ListPaged Data/
   Trends    Snapshot           Flights
```

---

## Performance Notes

- Always provide `startdate` / `enddate` to bound the query
- Use `modlist` or `aclist` to limit scope -- broad event queries can return thousands of records
- Use `[]` for `evcategory` and `evtype` when unsure of valid enum values
- `maxpages: 0` / `currentpage: 0` means results fit in one response -- same quirk as other paged endpoints

# JETNET Flight Data Integration

## Endpoints Covered

* `getFlightData` / `getFlightDataPaged` -- granular per-flight records
* `getFlights` (Aircraft Flight Summary) -- aggregated monthly utilization

---

## Two Endpoints, Two Roles

| Endpoint | Role | Data Level |
|----------|------|------------|
| **getFlightData** | Detailed, per-flight operational records | Transactional telemetry |
| **getFlights** | Aggregated monthly utilization statistics | Pre-aggregated cache |

```
getFlightData  → detailed events
        ↓ aggregation
getFlights     → monthly summaries
```

| Question | Correct Endpoint |
|----------|-----------------|
| Where did aircraft fly? | getFlightData |
| How active is aircraft monthly? | getFlights |
| Build utilization trend? | getFlights |
| Detect new travel patterns? | getFlightData |
| Estimate emissions? | getFlightData |

---

## 1. getFlightData (Detail)

### `POST /api/Aircraft/getFlightDataPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}`

Returns granular flight-level records for aircraft matching filters. This is the primary activity dataset and should be treated as the authoritative operational feed.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "aircraftid": 0,
  "airframetype": "None",
  "sernbr": "",
  "regnbr": "",
  "maketype": "None",
  "modelid": 0,
  "make": "",
  "origin": "",
  "destination": "",
  "startdate": "02/19/2026",
  "enddate": "02/20/2026",
  "aclist": [],
  "modlist": [1194],
  "exactMatchReg": true
}
```

### Key Filters

| Field | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `startdate / enddate` | **Required** for scalable queries. Use `MM/DD/YYYY` with leading zeros. |
| `modlist` | Most efficient filter (model-based retrieval). Use AMODID values from `references/model-id-table.json`. |
| `aclist` | Target specific aircraft IDs. Empty `[]` = no filter. |
| `origin / destination` | Airport filtering (ICAO codes). |
| `regnbr` | Tail-specific lookup. |
| `exactMatchReg` | Set `true` to prevent fuzzy matching. |

### Response Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `flightid` | Unique flight record ID |
| `flightdate` | Flight occurrence date |
| `origin_time` | Departure timing |
| `flighttime` | Minutes flown |
| `distance` | Flight distance |
| `estfuelburn` | Estimated fuel usage |
| `fuelburnrate` | Consumption rate |
| `estCO2emissions` | Environmental impact metric |
| `callsign` | Operational identifier |
| `origin` / `destination` | Route endpoints (ICAO codes) |

The response key is `flightdata` (array).

### Engineering Notes

- Model filtering (`modlist`) dramatically reduces payload size.
- Date range must be constrained -- large queries without filters may exceed backend limits.
- Response includes aircraft metadata + operational context (no extra joins required).
- Flight data already includes sustainability metrics (fuel burn, CO2) -- no external calculation needed.

---

## 2. getFlights (Monthly Summary)

### `GET /api/Aircraft/getFlights/{aircraftId}/{apiToken}`

Returns aggregated monthly utilization totals for a single aircraft. This is **not** flight-level detail -- it is summarized analytics per month.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "flights": [
    {
      "flightyear": 2025,
      "flightmonth": 2,
      "flights": 103,
      "flighthours": 240
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `flightyear` | Calendar year |
| `flightmonth` | Month (1-12) |
| `flights` | Number of flights in month |
| `flighthours` | Total hours flown in month |

This endpoint functions as a pre-aggregated utilization cache. It avoids needing to compute totals from raw flight records.

---

## 3. Ingestion Strategy

### Recommended Approach

```
FOR each model (modlist)
   FOR each day/week (date window)
      call getFlightDataPaged
```

- Batch by model, not fleet-wide pulls.
- Partition by date window (daily or weekly ingestion).
- Use `getFlights` periodically to snapshot monthly totals without re-processing raw records.

## 4. CRM & Analytics Signals

### Derived Signals from Flight Data

| Signal | Derived From |
|--------|-------------|
| Aircraft becoming active | Flight count increase (getFlights trend) |
| Charter behavior | High route diversity (getFlightData origins/destinations) |
| Ownership transition risk | Activity drop (getFlights trend) |
| Sustainability scoring | CO2 + fuel burn (getFlightData estCO2emissions) |
| FBO lead generation | Origin/destination patterns (getFlightData) |
| Utilization benchmarking | Monthly hours vs fleet average (getFlights) |

### Architecture

1. **Discovery Layer** -- Use aircraft endpoints to identify target fleet
2. **Activity Intelligence** -- Pull `getFlightData` in date-windowed batches, store normalized flight records
3. **Utilization Snapshot** -- Periodically call `getFlights`, store as `AircraftMonthlyUsage` for CRM scoring
4. **Derived Signals** -- Compute trends, detect behavioral changes, score leads

---

## 5. Key Takeaways

1. `getFlightData` is the core intelligence endpoint -- detailed, per-flight, includes route + emissions.
2. `getFlights` is an aggregation accelerator -- monthly totals without processing raw records.
3. Always use `modlist` or `aclist` filters. Never pull unfiltered fleet-wide data.
4. Always constrain date ranges. Daily or weekly windows are recommended.
5. These endpoints together enable behavioral aviation analytics: activity scoring, travel pattern detection, sustainability tracking, and CRM automation.

# Contacts

Contacts represent **people** in the JETNET ecosystem — chief pilots, directors of aviation, CEOs, dispatchers, and other decision-makers tied to aircraft and companies. A contact is a **relationship hub** connecting companies, aircraft, and listings, not just a person record.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | URL Pattern | Purpose |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| getContact | GET | `/api/Contact/getContact/{id}/{apiToken}` | Full contact record |
| getContactList | POST | `/api/Contact/getContactList/{apiToken}` | Search contacts |
| getContactListPaged | POST | `/api/Contact/getContactListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}` | Paginated contact search |
| getIdentification | GET | `/api/Contact/getIdentification/{id}/{apiToken}` | Identification-only record |
| getPhonenumbers | GET | `/api/Contact/getPhonenumbers/{id}/{apiToken}` | Phone numbers for a contact |
| getOtherlistings | GET | `/api/Contact/getOtherlistings/{id}/{apiToken}` | Alternate company/contact associations |
| getContAircraftRelationships | GET | `/api/Contact/getContAircraftRelationships/{id}/{apiToken}` | Aircraft relationships for a contact |

## Recommended Workflow

```
1. getContactList / getContactListPaged  →  search by name, company, aircraft
2. getIdentification                     →  lightweight verify before hydrating
3. getContact                            →  full profile (includes nested sub-records)
4. getContAircraftRelationships          →  aircraft linkage
5. getPhonenumbers                       →  communication data
6. getOtherlistings                      →  extended cross-company relationships
```

## Endpoint Details

### getContact

Returns a complete contact object including identification, phone numbers, and aircraft relationships when available.

```
GET /api/Contact/getContact/{contactId}/{apiToken}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "contact": {
    "identification": {
      "contactid": 343,
      "companyid": 215,
      "firstname": "William",
      "lastname": "Butler",
      "title": "President",
      "email": null
    },
    "phonenumbers": null,
    "aircraftrelationships": []
  }
}
```

**Response key:** `contact` (object with nested `identification`, `phonenumbers`, `aircraftrelationships`)

### getContactList

Search contacts by name, company, aircraft, or other criteria. Returns a non-paginated result set.

```
POST /api/Contact/getContactList/{apiToken}
```

**Request body** (`ContListOptions`):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `aircraftid` | array | Filter by aircraft IDs |
| `companyid` | integer | Filter by company ID |
| `companyname` | string | Filter by company name |
| `firstname` | string | Filter by first name |
| `lastname` | string | Filter by last name |
| `title` | string | Filter by title |
| `email` | string | Filter by email |
| `actiondate` | string | Changed-since date (MM/DD/YYYY) |
| `enddate` | string | Changed-before date (MM/DD/YYYY) |
| `phonenumber` | string | Filter by phone number |
| `contactchanges` | string | Filter by change type |
| `contlist` | array | Specific contact IDs |
| `complist` | array | Specific company IDs |

**Example request:**

```json
{
  "aircraftid": [23453, 241265, 2521],
  "companyname": "",
  "firstname": "",
  "lastname": ""
}
```

**Response key:** `contactlist` (array)

### getContactListPaged

Same search logic as `getContactList` but with pagination for large result sets.

```
POST /api/Contact/getContactListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
```

**Path params:** `pagesize` (integer), `page` (integer, 1-based)

**Request body:** Same `ContListOptions` as `getContactList`.

**Response includes:** `currentpage`, `maxpages`, `count`, `contacts[]`

Use this endpoint for data warehouse ingestion, CRM synchronization, and batch exports. See [pagination](pagination.md) for the standard paging pattern.

### getIdentification

Lightweight endpoint returning only identification metadata — useful when you need to verify a contact without pulling the full record.

```
GET /api/Contact/getIdentification/{contactId}/{apiToken}
```

**Returns:** Contact name, title, company ID, email, action date.

### getPhonenumbers

Retrieves phone numbers associated with a contact.

```
GET /api/Contact/getPhonenumbers/{contactId}/{apiToken}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [PHONE NUMBERS]",
  "count": 0,
  "phonenumbers": null
}
```

**Response key:** `phonenumbers` (array or `null`)

> `"SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND"` is **not an error** — it means the contact has no phone numbers on file. The `phonenumbers` field will be `null`, not `[]`. Always guard before iterating. See [Key Behaviors](#key-behaviors) below.

### getOtherlistings

Returns alternate company/contact associations — discover cross-company affiliations for a contact.

```
GET /api/Contact/getOtherlistings/{contactId}/{apiToken}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "count": 2,
  "otherlistings": [
    { "companyid": 214, "contactid": 342 }
  ]
}
```

**Response key:** `otherlistings` (array or `null`)

Use this to build relationship expansion graphs and discover contacts that span multiple organizations.

### getContAircraftRelationships

Returns aircraft relationships tied to a contact — which aircraft they are associated with and in what role.

```
GET /api/Contact/getContAircraftRelationships/{contactId}/{apiToken}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "aircraftrelationships": [
    {
      "aircraftid": 197551,
      "relationtype": "Additional Company/Contact",
      "isoperator": "N",
      "businesstype": "End User"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response key:** `aircraftrelationships` (array or `null`)

Use `aircraftid` from these results to call aircraft sub-record endpoints (`getAircraft`, `getRelationships`, etc.).

## Key Behaviors

### "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND" Is Normal

Many contact sub-endpoints return `"SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [PHONE NUMBERS]"` or similar when the contact exists but has no data for that sub-record. This is **not an error**. Use a prefix/startsWith check:

```python
status = data.get("responsestatus", "")
if status.upper().startswith("SUCCESS"):
    pass  # OK, even if "NO RESULTS FOUND"
elif "ERROR" in status.upper():
    raise ValueError(f"JETNET error: {status}")
```

```javascript
const status = data.responsestatus || "";
if (status.toUpperCase().startsWith("SUCCESS")) {
  // OK, even if "NO RESULTS FOUND"
} else if (status.toUpperCase().includes("ERROR")) {
  throw new Error(`JETNET error: ${status}`);
}
```

### Null Arrays, Not Empty Arrays

Fields like `phonenumbers`, `aircraftrelationships`, and `otherlistings` return `null` when there are no results — **not** an empty array `[]`. Always guard before calling `.map()`, `.forEach()`, or iterating:

```python
phones = data.get("phonenumbers") or []
for phone in phones:
    print(phone)
```

```javascript
const phones = data.phonenumbers ?? [];
phones.forEach((p) => console.log(p));
```

### contactid Is the Join Key

`contactid` is the primary key for all contact sub-record endpoints and the field you use to de-duplicate contacts across multiple aircraft or company records. Store `contactid` (not names) as your foreign key. See [ID System](id-system.md).

## Contact as a Relationship Hub

Contacts connect outward to three entity types:

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  Companies  │
                    │ (companyid) │
                    └──────▲──────┘
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              │         Contact         │
              │       (contactid)       │
              └────────────┼────────────┘
              │                         │
       ┌──────▼──────┐          ┌───────▼───────┐
       │   Aircraft   │          │   Listings    │
       │ (aircraftid) │          │ (otherlistings│
       └──────────────┘          └───────────────┘
```

- **Companies:** Every contact belongs to a company via `companyid`. Use `getIdentification` to see the primary company, or `getOtherlistings` to find additional affiliations.
- **Aircraft:** Use `getContAircraftRelationships` to find all aircraft linked to a contact. Each relationship includes `relationtype`, `isoperator`, and `businesstype`.
- **Listings:** `getOtherlistings` reveals alternate company/contact associations — the same person may appear under different companies with different `contactid` values.

## Common Use Cases

### CRM Enrichment

```
getContactListPaged (lastname="Smith", title="Chief Pilot")
  → for each contact:
      getContact/{contactid}        → full profile
      getPhonenumbers/{contactid}   → phone data
      getContAircraftRelationships/{contactid} → linked aircraft
```

### Ownership Intelligence

Starting from an aircraft, find decision-makers:

```
getRegNumber/{tailNumber}
  → extract contactid from companyrelationships
  → getContact/{contactid}         → full contact record
  → getOtherlistings/{contactid}   → cross-company links
```

### Incremental Sync

Use `actiondate` in `getContactListPaged` to pull only contacts that changed since your last sync:

```json
{
  "actiondate": "01/15/2025",
  "enddate": ""
}
```

# JETNET Company Endpoints

## Conceptual Model

Company endpoints let you search, retrieve, and expand company profiles. A "company" in JETNET is any legal entity with a relationship to aircraft: owners, operators, manufacturers, lessors, brokers, FBOs, and fractional providers all share the same `companyid` namespace.

Companies sit at the center of a relationship graph:

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  Contacts   │
                    │ (contactid) │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────┴──────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│   Aircraft   │────│   Company   │────│   Related    │
│ (aircraftid) │    │ (companyid) │    │  Companies   │
└──────────────┘    └──────┬──────┘    └──────────────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────┴──────┐
                    │   History   │
                    │  (transid)  │
                    └─────────────┘
```

---

## 1. getCompany (Full Record)

```
GET /api/Company/getCompany/{id}/{apiToken}
```

Returns the complete company object with nested sub-structures: identification, phone numbers, contacts, aircraft relationships, certifications, and related companies.

### Response Structure

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "company": {
    "identification": {
      "companyid": 4425,
      "parentcompanyid": 0,
      "name": "Acme Aviation LLC",
      "altname": "",
      "address1": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Dallas",
      "state": "Texas",
      "postcode": "75201",
      "country": "United States",
      "email": "info@acmeaviation.com",
      "website": "www.acmeaviation.com",
      "actiondate": "2025-01-15T00:00:00"
    },
    "phonenumbers": [...],
    "contacts": [...],
    "aircraftrelationships": [...],
    "relatedcompanies": null,
    "companycertifications": null
  }
}
```

### When to Use

Use this when you need the full company profile in a single call. For lightweight validation or display previews, prefer `getIdentification`.

---

## 2. getIdentification (Lightweight)

```
GET /api/Company/getIdentification/{id}/{apiToken}
```

Returns identification fields only. Useful for quick validation, UI previews, and confirming a `companyid` exists before making heavier calls.

### Response Key

`companyIdentification`

### Key Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `companyid` | integer | Primary key |
| `parentcompanyid` | integer | Parent company (0 = standalone) |
| `name` | string | Legal company name |
| `altname` | string | Alternate / DBA name |
| `address1` | string | Street address |
| `city` | string | City |
| `state` | string | State / province |
| `postcode` | string | Postal code |
| `country` | string | Country |
| `email` | string | Primary email |
| `website` | string | Company website |
| `actiondate` | string (ISO) | Last update timestamp |

---

## 3. getContacts (Contact IDs Only)

```
GET /api/Company/getContacts/{id}/{apiToken}
```

Returns an array of `contactid` integers associated with this company.

### Critical Behavior

This endpoint returns **ID arrays, not full contact objects**. You must call `Contact/getContact/{contactid}/{apiToken}` or `Contact/getIdentification/{contactid}/{apiToken}` for each ID to hydrate full contact records.

### Fan-Out Warning

A company with 20 contacts requires 20 follow-up calls. Limit concurrency and consider whether you truly need all contacts or just the primary ones from `getAircraftrelationships`.

```python
contact_ids = resp.get("contacts") or []
for cid in contact_ids[:10]:
    contact = session.get(f"/api/Contact/getIdentification/{cid}/{token}")
```

```javascript
const contactIds = data.contacts ?? [];
const results = [];
for (const cid of contactIds.slice(0, 10)) {
  results.push(await fetch(`${BASE}/api/Contact/getIdentification/${cid}/${TOKEN}`));
}
```

---

## 4. getPhonenumbers

```
GET /api/Company/getPhonenumbers/{id}/{apiToken}
```

### Response Structure

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "count": 2,
  "phonenumbers": [
    { "type": "Office", "number": "214-555-0100" },
    { "type": "Fax", "number": "214-555-0101" }
  ]
}
```

### Null Array Warning

When no phone numbers exist, the response is:

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [PHONE NUMBERS]",
  "count": 0,
  "phonenumbers": null
}
```

Always guard before iterating:

```python
phones = resp.get("phonenumbers") or []
```

```javascript
const phones = data.phonenumbers ?? [];
```

---

## 5. getRelatedcompanies

```
GET /api/Company/getRelatedcompanies/{id}/{apiToken}
```

Returns affiliated, parent, and subsidiary companies.

### Response Key

`relatedcompanies` (array or `null`)

### Typical Empty Response

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [RELATED COMPANIES]",
  "count": 0,
  "relatedcompanies": null
}
```

### When to Use

- Corporate family / hierarchy mapping
- Affiliate graph expansion
- Due diligence and relationship intelligence
- Understanding if an "operator" is a subsidiary of the named owner

---

## 6. getAircraftrelationships

```
GET /api/Company/getAircraftrelationships/{id}/{apiToken}
```

Returns all aircraft tied to this company and the nature of each relationship.

### Response Key

`aircraftrelationships` (array)

### Response Structure

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "count": 3,
  "aircraftrelationships": [
    {
      "aircraftid": 211461,
      "relationtype": "Owner",
      "relationseqno": 1,
      "contactid": 524808,
      "ownerpercent": null,
      "fractionexpiresdate": null,
      "isoperator": "N",
      "businesstype": "End User"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `aircraftid` | integer | Join key to Aircraft endpoints |
| `relationtype` | string | `"Owner"`, `"Operator"`, `"Additional Company/Contact"` |
| `relationseqno` | integer | Sequence number within this relation type |
| `contactid` | integer | Bridge to Contact endpoints |
| `ownerpercent` | number or null | Fractional ownership percentage (can be null) |
| `fractionexpiresdate` | string or null | Fractional share expiration |
| `isoperator` | string | `"Y"` or `"N"` (string, not boolean) |
| `businesstype` | string | `"End User"`, `"Dealer Broker"`, `"Charter Company"`, etc. |

### Gotchas

- `isoperator` is a `"Y"`/`"N"` **string**, not a boolean. Do not cast directly to boolean.
- `ownerpercent` and `fractionexpiresdate` can be `null` even when a relationship exists.
- `contactid` provides a direct bridge to Contact endpoints without needing `getContacts`.

---

## 7. getCompanyCertifications

```
GET /api/Company/getCompanyCertifications/{id}/{apiToken}
```

### Response Key

`companycertifications` (array or `null`)

### Typical Empty Response

```json
{
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [CERTIFICATIONS]",
  "count": 0,
  "companycertifications": null
}
```

This endpoint frequently returns empty results. Use for compliance, audits, or operator qualification workflows.

---

## 8. getCompanyHistory

```
POST /api/Company/getCompanyHistory/{apiToken}
POST /api/Company/getCompanyHistoryPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
```

Returns transaction history for one or more companies. Use when the question is "What aircraft has this company bought or sold?" rather than "What happened to this specific aircraft?"

### Request Body (`CompHistoryOptions`)

```json
{
  "companyid": 0,
  "complist": [2346, 12389],
  "aircraftid": 0,

| `companyid` | integer | Single company filter (0 = no filter) |
| `complist` | array | Multiple company IDs for bulk queries |
| `aircraftid` | integer | Single aircraft filter (0 = no filter) |
| `aclist` | array | Multiple aircraft IDs |
| `transtype` | array | `["None"]` (all), `["FullSale"]`, `["Lease"]`, etc. |
| `relationship` | array | Filter by relationship type |
| `startdate` / `enddate` | string | Date range (`MM/DD/YYYY`) |
| `lastactionstartdate` / `lastactionenddate` | string | Filter by JETNET record update date |

---

## Recommended Workflow

```
Search → Validate → Expand → Link to Aircraft/Contacts
```

1. **`getCompanyListPaged`** — find companies matching your criteria, get `companyid` values
2. **`getIdentification`** — lightweight confirm + display fields
3. **`getCompany`** — full profile when needed
4. **`getPhonenumbers`** — communications enrichment
5. **`getRelatedcompanies`** — expand corporate family graph
6. **`getAircraftrelationships`** — link aircraft and roles (includes `contactid` for bridging)
7. **`getContacts`** — get all contact IDs, then hydrate individually
8. **`getCompanyHistory`** — pull transaction change log

### Workflow Example (Python)

```python
companies = get_all_pages(bearer, token,
    f"/api/Company/getCompanyListPaged/{token}",
    {"bustype": ["Charter Company"], "state": ["TX"]},
    response_key="companies"
)

for comp in companies:
    cid = comp["companyid"]

    rels = session.get(
        f"{BASE}/api/Company/getAircraftrelationships/{cid}/{token}",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {bearer}"}
    ).json()

    aircraft_links = rels.get("aircraftrelationships") or []
    for link in aircraft_links:
        print(f"  Aircraft {link['aircraftid']} — {link['relationtype']}")
```

## Key Behaviors and Gotchas

### "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND" Is Normal

Several Company sub-endpoints return this status when no data exists. It is a valid business state, not an error. Use a prefix check:

```python
status = resp.get("responsestatus", "")
if status.upper().startswith("SUCCESS"):
    pass
elif "ERROR" in status.upper():
    raise ValueError(f"JETNET error: {status}")
```

```javascript
const status = data.responsestatus || "";
if (status.toUpperCase().startsWith("SUCCESS")) {
  // ok — may or may not contain data
} else if (status.toUpperCase().includes("ERROR")) {
  throw new Error(`JETNET error: ${status}`);
}
```

### Null Arrays

`phonenumbers`, `relatedcompanies`, `companycertifications`, and `contacts` can be `null` instead of `[]`. Always guard before calling `.map()`, `.forEach()`, or iterating:

```javascript
const phones = data.phonenumbers ?? [];
const related = data.relatedcompanies ?? [];
```

### `isoperator` Is a String

The `isoperator` field in aircraft relationships is `"Y"` or `"N"` (string), not a boolean. Direct boolean casting will treat both as truthy.

### `ownerpercent` Can Be Null

Even when a valid ownership relationship exists, `ownerpercent` may be `null`. Do not assume it is always populated for Owner relationships.

### Fan-Out / N+1 Risk

`getContacts` returns only an array of `contactid` integers. Hydrating each contact requires a separate API call. Batch your requests, limit concurrency, and consider whether `getAircraftrelationships` (which includes `contactid`) already provides the contacts you need.

# Model Data Endpoints

The JETNET API provides four Model endpoints that return manufacturer-level reference data for aircraft types. These endpoints are keyed by `modelid` (the numeric AMODID) and cover market trends, operating costs, performance specifications, and intelligence summaries.

`getModelMarketTrends` is documented separately in [Market Trends](trends.md). This guide covers the remaining three endpoints.

---

## Endpoints Overview

| Endpoint | Response Key | What It Returns |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `getModelOperationCosts` | `modeloperationcosts` | Annual operating cost breakdown per model |
| `getModelPerformanceSpecs` | `modelperformancespecs` | Physical dimensions, range, speed, cabin specs |
| `getModelIntelligence` | *(see below)* | Aggregated model intelligence summary |
| `getModelMarketTrends` | `modelMarketTrends` | Monthly pricing, inventory, days-on-market ([docs](trends.md)) |

All Model endpoints are `POST` requests with the token in the URL path.

---

## 1. getModelOperationCosts

`POST /api/Model/getModelOperationCosts/{apiToken}`

Returns annual operating cost estimates broken down by cost category for one or more models.

### Request Body (`ModelPerformanceOptions`)

```json
{
  "modlist": [278, 288],
  "airframetype": "None",
  "maketype": "None",
  "make": "",
  "annualhours": 400,
  "fuelprice": 6
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `modlist` | array | Model IDs to query (required for useful results) |
| `airframetype` | string | Airframe filter (`"None"` for all) |
| `maketype` | string | Make type filter (`"None"` for all) |
| `make` | string | Manufacturer name filter (empty string for all) |
| `annualhours` | integer | Assumed annual flight hours for cost projection (0 for defaults) |
| `fuelprice` | integer | Fuel price per gallon for cost projection (0 for defaults) |

### Response

```json
{
  "responseid": "123456789",
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "count": 2,
  "modeloperationcosts": [
    {
      "modelid": 278,
      "airframetype": "FixedWing",
      "maketype": "BusinessJet",
      "make": "GULFSTREAM",
      "model": "G550",
      "fuel_gal_cost": 6.00,
      "fuel_additive_cost": 0.05,
      "fuel_burn_rate": 280,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response key**: `modeloperationcosts` (all lowercase).

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `modelid` | Numeric model identifier |
| `make` / `model` | Manufacturer and model name |
| `fuel_gal_cost` | Fuel cost per gallon used in calculation |
| `fuel_additive_cost` | Fuel additive cost per gallon |
| `fuel_burn_rate` | Gallons per hour burn rate |

Additional cost fields cover crew, maintenance, insurance, hangar, and other variable and fixed operating expenses. The exact fields returned depend on the model and data availability.

---

## 2. getModelPerformanceSpecs

`POST /api/Model/getModelPerformanceSpecs/{apiToken}`

Returns physical dimensions, range, speed, payload, and cabin specifications for one or more models.

### Request Body (`ModelPerformanceOptions`)

```json
{
  "modlist": [145, 634],
  "airframetype": "None",
  "maketype": "None",
  "make": "",
  "annualhours": 0,
  "fuelprice": 0
}
```

Uses the same `ModelPerformanceOptions` schema as `getModelOperationCosts`. Set `annualhours` and `fuelprice` to `0` when only performance data is needed.

### Response

```json
{
  "responseid": "123456789",
  "responsestatus": "SUCCESS",
  "count": 2,
  "modelperformancespecs": [
    {
      "modelid": 145,
      "airframetype": "FixedWing",
      "maketype": "BusinessJet",
      "make": "CESSNA",
      "model": "CITATION X",
      "fuselage_length": 73.3,
      "fuselage_height": 5.7,
      "fuselage_wing_span": 63.6,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response key**: `modelperformancespecs` (all lowercase).

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `modelid` | Numeric model identifier |
| `make` / `model` | Manufacturer and model name |
| `fuselage_length` | Overall fuselage length |
| `fuselage_height` | Fuselage height |
| `fuselage_wing_span` | Wingspan |

Additional fields cover cabin dimensions (length, width, height), range, max speed, cruise speed, max altitude, max passengers, baggage volume, and engine specifications. Field availability varies by model.

---

## 3. getModelIntelligence

`POST /api/Model/getModelIntelligence/{apiToken}`

Returns an aggregated intelligence summary for the requested models. This endpoint combines fleet population, market positioning, and classification metadata.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "modlist": [278],
  "airframetype": "None",
  "maketype": "None",
  "make": ""
}
```

### Notes

- The request body must be valid JSON. Malformed bodies (e.g., unmatched brackets) return a `400` validation error.
- Consult the API documentation or test in Postman for the exact response structure, as field availability depends on the model and subscription tier.

---

## Common Patterns

### Shared Request Schema

`getModelOperationCosts` and `getModelPerformanceSpecs` share the same `ModelPerformanceOptions` request body. You can query both endpoints with the same payload to get a complete cost-plus-performance picture for a set of models.

### Response Key Casing

| Endpoint | Response Key |
|----------|-------------|
| `getModelOperationCosts` | `modeloperationcosts` (lowercase) |
| `getModelPerformanceSpecs` | `modelperformancespecs` (lowercase) |
| `getModelMarketTrends` | `modelMarketTrends` (camelCase with capital M) |

The inconsistent casing between `modelMarketTrends` and the other two endpoints is a known API quirk. Always use the exact key shown above when extracting data from responses.

### Model ID Lookup

All Model endpoints require `modlist` (an array of numeric model IDs). To find the right IDs:

- Use the [Model ID Reference](../references/model-ids.md) table
- Run `python scripts/model_search.py "G550"` to search by name
- Call `POST /api/Utility/getAircraftModelList/{apiToken}` at runtime

An empty `modlist: []` returns all models (potentially very large result sets).

---

## Use Cases

### Operating Cost Benchmarks

Compare annual operating costs across competing models to support fleet planning or acquisition decisions.

```python
body = {
    "modlist": [278, 288, 663],
    "airframetype": "None",
    "maketype": "None",
    "make": "",
    "annualhours": 400,
    "fuelprice": 6
}
costs = api_post(f"/api/Model/getModelOperationCosts/{token}", body)
for item in costs["modeloperationcosts"]:
    print(f"{item['make']} {item['model']}: fuel burn {item['fuel_burn_rate']} gal/hr")
```

### Performance Comparisons

Evaluate range, speed, and cabin size across models for mission-fit analysis.

```python
body = {
    "modlist": [145, 634],
    "airframetype": "None",
    "maketype": "None",
    "make": "",
    "annualhours": 0,
    "fuelprice": 0
}
specs = api_post(f"/api/Model/getModelPerformanceSpecs/{token}", body)
for item in specs["modelperformancespecs"]:
    print(f"{item['make']} {item['model']}: length {item['fuselage_length']}")
```

### Valuation Support

Combine `getModelOperationCosts` with `getModelMarketTrends` ([docs](trends.md)) to contextualize asking prices against operating economics. High operating costs relative to market value can signal depreciation pressure; low costs relative to peers can indicate value opportunities.

### Full Model Profile

Query all three endpoints with the same `modlist` to build a complete model profile:

1. **Performance** (`getModelPerformanceSpecs`) -- what the aircraft can do
2. **Costs** (`getModelOperationCosts`) -- what it costs to operate
3. **Market** (`getModelMarketTrends`) -- what the market is doing

# Airports

The Airports endpoint provides standardized airport reference data used across flight operations, basing analysis, and geographic market intelligence. Unlike transactional datasets (flights, events, history), airports represent **static infrastructure entities** that enable consistent geographic normalization and spatial aggregation.

This dataset functions as a **dimension table** within analytics pipelines -- the spatial index that ties together flights, events, snapshots, and market trends.

---

## Endpoint

### `POST /api/Utility/getAirportList/{apiToken}`

Returns airport records matching the provided filters. All parameters are optional and can be combined.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "city": "",
  "state": [],
  "statename": [],
  "country": "",
  "iata": "",
  "icao": "",
  "faaid": ""
}
```

### Request Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Airport name filter |
| `city` | string | City filter |
| `state` | array[string] | State/province abbreviations |
| `statename` | array[string] | Full state names |
| `country` | string | Country filter |
| `iata` | string | IATA airport code (e.g., `"SLK"`) |
| `icao` | string | ICAO airport identifier (e.g., `"KSLK"`) |
| `faaid` | string | FAA identifier (U.S. airports) |

### Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `airportid` | Unique JETNET airport identifier |
| `name` | Airport name |
| `city` | Associated city |
| `state` | State or region |
| `country` | Country |
| `iata` | IATA code |
| `icao` | ICAO code |
| `faaid` | FAA identifier (where applicable) |

### Example: Lookup by ICAO

```python
resp = session.post(
    f"{BASE}/api/Utility/getAirportList/{token}",
    json={"icao": "KTEB"}
)
airports = resp.json()  # array of matching airport records
```

### Example: Filter by State

```python
resp = session.post(
    f"{BASE}/api/Utility/getAirportList/{token}",
    json={"state": ["NY", "NJ"]}
)
airports = resp.json()
```

---

## Role as a Dimension Table

Airports serve as the geographic backbone for nearly every other dataset in the JETNET API. The relationship model:

```
Airports (Dimension)
    ↓
Flights (Fact)      -- origin / destination fields join to ICAO/IATA
Events (Fact)       -- location context for lifecycle changes
Snapshots (Fact)    -- base airport for ownership state
Market Trends (Fact) -- regional aggregation layer
```

Key join fields across datasets:

| Dataset | Join Field | Airport Key |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Flight Data (`getFlightData`) | `origin` / `destination` | ICAO code |
| Aircraft base location | `basecode` | Airport identifier |
| Condensed Snapshots | Base fields | Airport identifier |

---

## Analytical Applications

### 1. Traffic Analysis

Join airport data with `getFlightData` to produce:

- Traffic volume by airport
- Origin/destination heatmaps
- Route density analysis
- Regional utilization trends

### 2. Basing Distribution

Combined with snapshots (`getCondensedSnapshot`) and ownership data:

- Aircraft basing distribution by airport/region
- Fleet geographic migration over time
- Operator regional concentration

### 3. Geographic Migration

Track how fleet basing shifts across time windows by comparing snapshot data against the airport dimension:

- Quarter-over-quarter base changes
- Country-level fleet growth
- Emerging operational hubs

### 4. Event Correlation

Paired with aircraft events (`getEventListPaged`):

- Base change tracking
- Operational relocations
- Market entry/exit signals by region

### 5. Market & Trend Modeling

Supports aggregation for:

- Activity by metropolitan region
- Country-level fleet growth
- Airport ecosystem analysis

---

## Time-Series Opportunities

Although airports themselves are static, they enable derived time-series when joined with temporal datasets:

| Derived Series | Source |
|---------------|--------|
| Monthly operations per airport | `getFlightData` grouped by origin/destination |
| Aircraft counts by airport over time | `getCondensedSnapshot` with base fields |
| Event density by region | `getEventListPaged` grouped by location |
| Fleet migration timelines | Sequential snapshots compared against airport dimension |

Airports function as the **spatial index** for all temporal datasets.

---

## Caching Recommendation

Airport data changes very infrequently. Recommended approach:

- **Cache locally** after initial fetch
- **Refresh schedule**: weekly or monthly is sufficient
- **Normalization**: use ICAO codes as the canonical join key across datasets (most consistent identifier)
- Maintain a local airport dimension table for analytics joins

---

## Best Practices

1. **Normalize geographic references** against ICAO codes when possible -- they are the most globally consistent identifier.
2. **Maintain airport dimension keys** in your data warehouse for consistent analytics joins.
3. **Use airports to avoid free-text geographic fragmentation** -- raw city/state strings in other datasets can be inconsistent.
4. **Cache aggressively** -- this is a low-volatility reference dataset.
5. **Filter narrowly** when querying -- use specific `icao`, `iata`, or `state` parameters rather than pulling the entire list repeatedly.

# Utility & Reference Endpoints

## Conceptual Model

The Utility endpoints provide **foundational reference data** -- the controlled vocabularies, classification taxonomies, and enumeration values that every other JETNET endpoint depends on. They are the metadata backbone of the API.

Think of them as **dimension tables** in a data warehouse: they define the valid values for `lifecycle`, `airframetype`, `maketype`, `modelid`, `categorysize`, event categories, and more. Without them, you cannot reliably filter, join, or interpret data from Aircraft, Company, Contact, Model, or Flight endpoints.

```

├── Airframe Types      ← FixedWing / Rotary

## Caching Strategy

Utility endpoints return slowly-changing reference data. Cache aggressively to reduce API calls and improve performance.

| Endpoint | Cache Duration | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Airframe Types | Static | Enum-level data (`FixedWing`, `Rotary`) -- never changes |
| Lifecycle Status | Long-lived (weekly+) | Rarely changes |
| Make List | Long-lived (weekly+) | OEM list is stable |
| JNIQ Sizes | Long-lived (weekly+) | Classification taxonomy, rarely modified |
| Weight Classes | Long-lived (weekly+) | Regulatory categories, stable |
| Event Categories | Long-lived (weekly+) | Domain groupings, rarely modified |
| Event Types | Long-lived (weekly+) | Specific signals per category, stable |
| Business Types | Long-lived (weekly+) | Company classification, stable |
| Relationship Types | Long-lived (weekly+) | Relationship vocabulary, stable |
| History Trans Types | Long-lived (weekly+) | Transaction categories, stable |
| Country List | Long-lived (weekly+) | Countries rarely added |
| State List | Long-lived (weekly+) | States/provinces rarely change |
| Model List | Daily refresh | Occasionally expanded with new models |
| Make Type List | Long-lived (weekly+) | Propulsion categories, stable |
| Product Codes | Session-level | Account-specific, check at startup |

### Recommended Pattern

```python
import json, os, time

CACHE_DIR = ".cache/jetnet"
CACHE_TTL = 86400

def get_cached_or_fetch(name, fetch_fn):
    path = f"{CACHE_DIR}/{name}.json"
    if os.path.exists(path):
        age = time.time() - os.path.getmtime(path)

## Data Architecture Role

These utility endpoints form the **metadata backbone** that all other JETNET APIs depend on:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Operational Endpoints             │
│  Aircraft · Companies · Contacts · Flights  │
│  Events · History · Snapshots · Trends      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Reference Layer (Utility)         │
│  Models · Makes · Lifecycle · Airframe      │
│  JNIQ Sizes · Event Cats · Business Types   │
│  Countries · States · Relationships         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Without the utility layer:
- You cannot resolve `modelid` values for trend queries
- You cannot validate enum filter values before sending requests
- You risk sending invalid filter strings that return errors inside `responsestatus`
- You cannot build reliable cascading filters (Airframe → Make → Model)

---

## Integration Priority

**Tier 1 -- Required immediately:**
- Aircraft Model List (`modelid` is used everywhere)
- Lifecycle Status (core filter for fleet analytics)

**Tier 2 -- Strongly recommended:**
- Make List (manufacturer taxonomy)
- JNIQ Sizes (category segmentation)
- Event Categories / Event Types (if using events)

**Tier 3 -- Supportive metadata:**
- Airframe Types (static enum, can hardcode)
- Weight Classes
- Business Types, Relationship Types, History Trans Types
- Country / State Lists
- Product Codes, Account Info

# Common Mistakes

## Authentication

### `emailAddress` has a capital A

The login field is `emailAddress` — not `email`, `emailaddress`, or `email_address`. This is the single most common auth mistake.

```json
// Wrong
{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "..." }
{ "emailaddress": "user@example.com", "password": "..." }

// Correct
{ "emailAddress": "user@example.com", "password": "..." }
```

### `apiToken` goes in the URL path only

The `apiToken` is placed in the URL path — never in headers or the JSON body.

```
// Wrong
Authorization: Bearer {bearerToken} {apiToken}
{ "apiToken": "abc123", ... }

// Correct
GET /api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/N123AB/{apiToken}
Authorization: Bearer {bearerToken}
```

## Response Handling

### HTTP 200 does not mean success

JETNET returns HTTP 200 for most responses, including errors. Always check `responsestatus`:

```python
result = r.json()
if "ERROR" in result.get("responsestatus", "").upper():
    raise ValueError(f"JETNET error: {result['responsestatus']}")
```

### `companyrelation` vs `relationtype`

Different endpoints use different field names for the relationship type. Using the wrong field returns nothing:

| Endpoint | Field Name |
|----------|-----------|
| `getRegNumber` | `companyrelation` |
| `getHistoryList` / `getRelationships` | `relationtype` |
| `getBulkAircraftExport` | Field prefix (`owr*`, `opr*`, `chp*`) |
| `getAcCompanyFractionalReportPaged` | `relation` |

See [Response Handling](response-handling.md) for the full schema comparison.

### `"SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND"` is a normal response

Several endpoints return `responsestatus` values like `"SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [PHONE NUMBERS]"` when a query matches zero records. This is **not an error** — it is a valid business state. Use a prefix check, not strict equality:

```python
# Wrong — breaks on "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [...]"
if result["responsestatus"] != "SUCCESS":
    raise ValueError("Request failed")

# Correct — treats any SUCCESS prefix as OK
if not result.get("responsestatus", "").upper().startswith("SUCCESS"):
    raise ValueError(f"JETNET error: {result['responsestatus']}")
```

```javascript
// Wrong
if (data.responsestatus !== "SUCCESS") throw new Error("Failed");

// Correct
if (!(data.responsestatus || "").toUpperCase().startsWith("SUCCESS")) {
  throw new Error(`JETNET error: ${data.responsestatus}`);
}
```

### Null arrays — guard before iterating

Fields like `phonenumbers`, `relatedcompanies`, and `companycertifications` return `null` (not `[]`) when empty. Any code calling `.map()` or `.forEach()` without a guard will crash:

```python
# Wrong — TypeError if phonenumbers is None
for p in result["phonenumbers"]:
    print(p)

# Correct
for p in result.get("phonenumbers") or []:
    print(p)
```

```javascript
// Wrong — Cannot read properties of null
data.phonenumbers.map(p => p.number);

// Correct
(data.phonenumbers ?? []).map(p => p.number);
```

### `isoperator` is a `"Y"` / `"N"` string

In relationship data, `isoperator` is a string, not a boolean:

```python
# Wrong — always truthy because "N" is a non-empty string
if record["isoperator"]:

# Correct
if record["isoperator"] == "Y":
```

## URL Shape Variations

### Mixed URL patterns across endpoints

JETNET endpoints use three different URL patterns. Trying to build all paths with a single template will break:

```
# Pattern 1: POST body + token only
POST /api/Contact/getContactList/{apiToken}

# Pattern 2: Resource ID + token
GET /api/Contact/getContact/{contactId}/{apiToken}

# Pattern 3: Token + pagination in path
POST /api/Aircraft/getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pageSize}/{page}
```

Build your URL helper to accept optional `id`, `pageSize`, and `page` parameters rather than assuming one shape fits all.

## N+1 and Fan-Out Risks

### Company → Contacts returns ID arrays, not full objects

`getContacts` (`/api/Company/getContacts/{companyId}/{apiToken}`) returns contact IDs as a plain array — not hydrated contact objects:

```json
{ "contacts": [523097, 282591, 198443] }
```

To get full contact data, you must call `getContact` or `getIdentification` for **each** ID. This creates an N+1 fan-out problem. Mitigate with concurrency limits:

```python
import asyncio

sem = asyncio.Semaphore(5)

async def fetch_contact(session, contact_id):
    async with sem:
        return await session.get(f".../getContact/{contact_id}/{token}")

tasks = [fetch_contact(session, cid) for cid in contact_ids]
contacts = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

```javascript
// Limit concurrency to 5 at a time
const pLimit = (await import("p-limit")).default;
const limit = pLimit(5);

const contacts = await Promise.all(
  contactIds.map(id => limit(() => fetchContact(id)))
);
```

### `ownerpercent` can be null even when relationship exists

Do not assume `ownerpercent` or `fractionexpiresdate` are always populated on ownership/fractional relationships. Always provide a fallback:

```python
pct = record.get("ownerpercent") or "0.00"
```

## Filters and Payloads

### Empty `aclist: []` means no filter, not empty results

Sending `"aclist": []` does not return zero results — it removes the aircraft filter entirely, returning all matching records. Be intentional:

```json
// Returns ALL aircraft (no filter)
{ "aclist": [], "modlist": [] }

// Returns only these specific aircraft
{ "aclist": [128228, 242781], "modlist": [] }
```

### `transtype: ["None"]` not `[]` for all history types

To get all transaction types in history queries, send `["None"]` — not an empty array:

```json
// Wrong — may not return all types
{ "transtype": [] }

// Correct — returns all transaction types
{ "transtype": ["None"] }
```

## Date Formatting

### Use `MM/DD/YYYY` with leading zeros

JETNET requires `MM/DD/YYYY` format with leading zeros:

```json
// Wrong
{ "startdate": "1/1/2024" }

// Correct
{ "startdate": "01/01/2024" }
```

### `getBulkAircraftExport` accepts datetime strings

The `actiondate` and `enddate` fields accept full datetime strings for hourly polling windows:

```json
{ "actiondate": "02/26/2026 10:00:00", "enddate": "02/26/2026 11:00:00" }
```

## String Booleans

### `forsale` in responses is a string

In most endpoints, `forsale` is `"true"` or `"false"` (strings), not JSON booleans:

```python
# Wrong
if record["forsale"]:  # Always truthy because it's a non-empty string

# Correct
if record["forsale"] == "true":
```

### `getBulkAircraftExport` uses `"Y"` / `"N"` for forsale

The bulk export endpoint uses a different convention:

```python
# In getBulkAircraftExport
if record["forsale"] == "Y":
```

### `datepurchased` format differs in bulk export

In `getBulkAircraftExport`, `datepurchased` is `YYYYMMDD` format (not `MM/DD/YYYY`).

## Endpoint-Specific Issues

### `getAircraftList` has no paged variant

Unlike most list endpoints, `getAircraftList` does not have a paged version. Use filters (`modlist`, geographic params, `forsale`) to control result size.

### `getEventList` enum values are strict

Sending unrecognized enum values to `getEventList` produces an `ERROR` in `responsestatus` despite HTTP 200. Use `getEventTypes` and `getEventCategories` to get valid values first.

### `getBulkAircraftExport` returns `maxpages: 0` for single-page results

When all results fit in one call, the response has `maxpages: 0` and `currentpage: 0`. Use `max(maxpages, 1)` in your loop or you will exit immediately and miss all records:

```python
if page >= max(data.get("maxpages", 1), 1):
    break
```

### `getAcCompanyFractionalReportPaged` response key

The response key is `aircraftcompfractionalrefs`. Each row is one relationship per aircraft:

- `fractionPercentOwned: "100.00"` = actual owner
- `fractionPercentOwned: "0.00"` = operator/manager on same aircraft
- The `relationship` filter is an array: `["Fractional Owner"]`

## Field Name Gotchas

### `getRegNumber` flat companyrelationships

The flat schema uses `companyrelation` and prefixed fields (`companyname`, `contactfirstname`). For FBO ramp contact lookup, filter on `contacttitle` for Chief Pilot, Director of Aviation, Scheduler, or Dispatcher.

### `getBulkAircraftExport` flat prefixed schema

Role-prefixed fields: `owr*` = owner, `opr*` = operator, `chp*` = chief pilot, `excbrk1*`/`excbrk2*` = brokers, `addl1-3*` = additional. This is not the same schema as `getRegNumber` or `getRelationships`.

Filters by aircraft airframe category.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | No filter (all airframe types) |
| `FixedWing` | Fixed-wing aircraft |
| `Rotary` | Rotorcraft (helicopters) |

## maketype

Filters by aircraft propulsion/category.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | No filter (all make types) |
| `JetAirliner` | Commercial jet airliners |
| `BusinessJet` | Business jets |
| `Turboprop` | Turboprop aircraft |
| `Piston` | Piston-engine aircraft |
| `Turbine` | Turbine-powered (helicopters) |

## lifecycle

Filters by aircraft operational status.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | No filter (all lifecycle stages) |
| `InProduction` | Currently being manufactured |
| `NewWithManufacturer` | Completed but not yet delivered |
| `InOperation` | Active and in service |
| `Retired` | Permanently out of service |
| `InStorage` | Temporarily inactive / stored |

## forsale (Request)

Filters by for-sale status in request payloads. These are **string values**, not booleans.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"true"` | Only aircraft listed for sale |
| `"false"` | Only aircraft not listed for sale |
| `""` | No filter (all aircraft) |

> **Note:** In `getBulkAircraftExport` responses, `forsale` uses `"Y"` / `"N"` instead.

## isnewaircraft / ispreownedtrans / isinternaltrans

Three-state filters used in history and transaction queries.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"Yes"` | Include only matching records |
| `"No"` | Exclude matching records |
| `"Ignore"` | No filter on this field |

## transtype (Request)

Transaction type categories used in history list request payloads. These are **category labels**, not the full descriptive strings returned in responses.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"None"` | All transaction types (no filter) |
| `"FullSale"` | Full sale transactions |
| `"Lease"` | Lease transactions |
| `"InternalSale"` | Internal/corporate transfers |
| `"Management"` | Management changes |
| `"Insurance"` | Insurance-related transactions |

> **Important:** Use `["None"]` (not `[]`) to retrieve all transaction types.

## transtype (Response)

In **response** records, `transtype` is a full descriptive string. These are different from the request category values.

Examples of response values:
- `"Full Sale - Retail to Retail"`
- `"Full Sale - Retail to Wholesale"`
- `"Lease - Operating Lease"`
- `"Internal Sale - Corporate Restructure"`

Do not use response `transtype` values in request payloads — they will not match.

|-------|-------------|
| `"GULFSTREAM"` | Gulfstream Aerospace |
| `"BOMBARDIER"` | Bombardier Aviation |
| `"DASSAULT"` | Dassault Aviation |
