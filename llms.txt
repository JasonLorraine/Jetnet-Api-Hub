## MCP Server (Native AI Agent Integration)

A production-ready MCP server exists at mcp/jetnet_mcp.py. If you are an AI agent
with MCP support (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Copilot), you can connect directly to
JETNET without writing HTTP code. The server handles authentication, token refresh,
pagination, and all JETNET guardrails automatically.

Available tools: jetnet_golden_path, jetnet_lookup_aircraft, jetnet_get_relationships,
jetnet_get_flight_data, jetnet_search_fleet, jetnet_get_history,
jetnet_get_market_trends, jetnet_search_models, jetnet_get_snapshot,
jetnet_get_model_specs, jetnet_health_check.

Setup: pip install mcp httpx pydantic, then configure your MCP client to run
mcp/jetnet_mcp.py with JETNET_EMAIL and JETNET_PASSWORD env vars.

If you do NOT have MCP support, continue with the HTTP API documentation below.

## Common Use Cases

- Aircraft Sales & Brokerage: tail lookup, owner identification, for-sale inventory, comparable sales history
- Fleet Intelligence: fleet composition by model/country/operator, ownership tracking, lifecycle monitoring
- Market Analytics: pricing trends, inventory levels, days-on-market, supply/demand time-series
- CRM Enrichment: ownership contacts, flight activity, base airport, charter/fractional identification
- Data Integration: bulk export with delta sync, automated ownership change alerts, transaction monitoring
- Valuation & Diligence: market benchmarks, transaction history, utilization data, operating costs

See references/vertical-playbooks.md for 9 detailed industry-specific workflows.

## Authentication

POST /api/Admin/APILogin
Body: { "emailAddress": "...", "password": "..." }
Response: { "bearerToken": "...", "apiToken": "..." }

Rules:
- Field is `emailAddress` (capital A). Not `email`, `emailaddress`, or `email_address`.
- `bearerToken` goes in header: `Authorization: Bearer {bearerToken}`
- `apiToken` goes in URL path only: `/api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/N123AB/{apiToken}`
- Never put apiToken in headers or body. Never put bearerToken in the URL.
- Tokens expire after 60 minutes. Proactively refresh at 50 minutes.
- Validate with: GET /api/Admin/getAccountInfo/{apiToken}
- On "INVALID SECURITY TOKEN": re-login once and retry. Never loop.

## Critical Gotchas

1. HTTP 200 does NOT mean success. Always check `responsestatus` for "ERROR".
2. `transtype: ["None"]` not `[]` for all transaction types.
3. `forsale` is string `"true"`/`"false"` in requests, `"Y"`/`"N"` in bulk export responses.
4. Dates must be `MM/DD/YYYY` with leading zeros. Month first, not day.
5. `modlist: []` means no filter (all models), not empty results.
6. `aclist: []` means no filter (all aircraft), not empty results.
7. `maxpages: 0` from bulk export = single page. Use `max(maxpages, 1)`.
8. `companyrelation` (getRegNumber flat) vs `relationtype` (getRelationships nested) -- different endpoints use different field names.
9. `regnbr` (tail number) can change. Use `aircraftid` as your stable database key.
10. Pagination is 1-based (first page = 1, not 0).

## The Golden Path (Tail Lookup)

1. GET /api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/{tailNumber}/{apiToken} -> aircraftresult (includes aircraftid)
2. GET /api/Aircraft/getPictures/{aircraftid}/{apiToken} -> pictures[]
   POST /api/Aircraft/getRelationships/{apiToken} body: {"aclist":[aircraftid],"modlist":[]} -> relationships[]
   POST /api/Aircraft/getFlightDataPaged/{apiToken}/100/1 body: {"aclist":[aircraftid],"modlist":[],...} -> flightdata[]
3. POST /api/Aircraft/getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/100/1 body: {"aclist":[aircraftid],"modlist":[],"transtype":["None"],...} -> history[] (lazy)

All POST endpoints require a JSON body with at minimum aclist and modlist. See prompts/ or docs/ for full payload shapes.

transtype (request categories): None, FullSale, Lease, InternalSale, Management, Insurance, Repossession, Registration
  NOTE: Response transtype values are different (descriptive strings like "Full Sale - Retail to Retail"). Do not use response values in request payloads.

## ID System

| ID | Type | Purpose | Stable? |
|----|------|---------|---------|
| aircraftid | int | Primary key for aircraft, join key for all sub-records | Yes |
| regnbr | string | Tail number (human-readable) | No -- can change |

## Model IDs (modlist)

872 unique model IDs across 67 makes and 5 make types.
Full machine-readable table: references/model-id-table.json

Common examples:
- Gulfstream G550: modlist [278]
- Gulfstream G650 + G650ER: modlist [663, 1211]
- Citation Latitude: modlist [1167]
- All Citation CJ3 variants: modlist [279, 1194]
- Challenger 350: modlist [1188]
- King Air 350: modlist [142]
- Bell 407: modlist [100]
- modlist: [] = no filter (all models)

## Pagination Pattern

URL: POST .../getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
Pages are 1-based. Use `maxpages` for loop control.

```python
results, page = [], 1
while True:
    data = api("POST", f"{path}/{pagesize}/{page}", bearer, token, body)
    for key in ["history","flightdata","events","aircraft","aircraftowneroperators","companylist","contactlist","relationships","aircraftcompfractionalrefs"]:
        if key in data and isinstance(data[key], list):
            results.extend(data[key])
            break
    if page >= max(data.get("maxpages", 1), 1):
        break
    page += 1
```

## Schema Differences (Owner/Operator)

| Endpoint | Schema | Relation Field |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| getRegNumber | Flat: companyname, contactfirstname | companyrelation |
| getRelationships / getHistoryList | Nested: company.name, contact.firstname | relationtype |
| getBulkAircraftExport | Prefixed: owrcompanyname, oprcompanyname | prefix (owr*, opr*, chp*) |
| getAcCompanyFractionalReportPaged | Flat: companyname | relation |

## Normalized Response Shapes

AircraftCard: aircraftId, modelId, tailNumber, serialNumber, make, model, yearMfr, yearDelivered, makeType, airframeType, weightClass, categorySize, lifecycle, forSale, owner (CompanyCard), operator (CompanyCard)

CompanyCard: companyId, name, city, state, country, phone, email, contact (ContactCard)

ContactCard: contactId, firstName, lastName, title, email, phone

GoldenPathResult: aircraftId, tailNumber, make, model, yearMfr, yearDelivered, categorySize, weightClass, forSale, askingPrice, owner, operator, chiefPilot, baseIcao, baseAirport, baseCountry, dataSource="JETNET"

## Aircraft Endpoints (docs/aircraft.md)

Three access patterns for aircraft data:

1. Full record: GET /api/Aircraft/getAircraft/{id}/{apiToken} -> `aircraft` (composite with all sub-records)
2. Sub-records (14 GET endpoints, all /api/Aircraft/{endpoint}/{id}/{apiToken}):
   - getIdentification -> identification | getStatus -> status | getAirframe -> airframe (aftt, landings)
   - getEngine -> engine (engines[] sub-array) | getApu -> apu (null if missing) | getAvionics -> avionics[]
   - getFeatures -> features[] | getAdditionalEquipment -> additionalequipment[] | getInterior -> interior
   - getExterior -> exterior | getMaintenance -> maintenance | getLeases -> leases (null if missing)
   - getPictures -> pictures[] | getCompanyrelationships -> companyrelationships[] (isoperator is "Y"/"N" string)
3. Quick lookup: GET /api/Aircraft/getRegNumber/{tail}/{apiToken} -> aircraftresult (flat schema)
   GET /api/Aircraft/getHexNumber/{hex}/{apiToken} -> aircraft

Fleet search: POST /api/Aircraft/getAircraftList/{apiToken} -> aircraft[] (no paged variant -- use filters to limit)
Batch relationships: POST /api/Aircraft/getRelationships/{apiToken} -> relationships[] (nested schema with relationtype)
Bulk detail: POST /api/Aircraft/getAllAircraftObjects/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page} -> allaircraftobjects[] (requires aclist)

Gotchas:
- getApu returns null with "SUCCESS: NO RESULTS FOUND [APU]" -- still starts with "SUCCESS"
- getEngine has engine.engines[] sub-array (two levels: model data + per-engine data)
- getCompanyrelationships.isoperator is string "Y"/"N" not boolean
- getAircraftList has NO paged variant; use getBulkAircraftExportPaged for large datasets
- getRegNumber uses flat schema (companyrelation); getRelationships uses nested (relationtype)
- getFlights (flight summary) is at /api/Aircraft/getFlights/{id}/{apiToken} -> flightsummary

## Bulk Export (getBulkAircraftExportPaged)

Two operating modes:
- Snapshot: omit `aircraftchanges` -> full dataset matching filters
- Delta: `aircraftchanges=true` -> aircraft with changes since your last API call (backend tracks this automatically)

Key behaviors:
- Delta uses graph-based change detection: aircraft qualifies if ANY related entity changes (ownership, contacts, events, flights) -- not just the aircraft record.
- Delta returns full records, not field-level diffs. Always upsert entire records.
- `aircraftchanges=true` means "since last call" -- the backend tracks the cursor, not the client.
- `actiondate`/`enddate` are optional date-range filters, not the change cursor. Accepts `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS`.
- Entity counts scale nonlinearly: each aircraft expands into companies, contacts, phones, events, flight summaries.
- Always scope with `modlist` or `aclist`. Unbounded queries create massive payloads.
- Response uses flat prefixed schema: owr* (owner), opr* (operator), chp* (chief pilot).
- `forsale` is "Y"/"N" (not "true"/"false"). `datepurchased` is YYYYMMDD.
- `maxpages: 0` = single page. Use max(maxpages, 1).

Integration pattern: initial full snapshot -> store locally -> periodic delta pulls with aircraftchanges=true -> upsert entire records.

## History Endpoints (getHistoryListPaged / getCompanyHistoryPaged)

History records are transaction EVENTS, not aircraft state. Each record = a sale, lease, transfer, or relationship change.

POST /api/Aircraft/getHistoryListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}
POST /api/Company/getCompanyHistoryPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}

Key behaviors:
- Response key: `history` (array). Uses nested relationship schema (company:{}, contact:{} sub-objects).
- `transtype` in request = categories ("FullSale", "Lease", "None"); in response = descriptive strings ("Full Sale - Retail to Retail").
- `isnewaircraft` and `isinternaltrans` are tristate: "Yes", "No", "Ignore".
- `allrelationships: true` returns all parties: Seller, Purchaser, Operator, Seller's Broker, Purchaser's Broker.
- `soldprice`/`askingprice` are often null (confidential deals). `transretail: true` = arm's length retail transaction.
- `transdate` = actual transaction date. `actiondate` = when JETNET last updated the record.
- History records are event pointers — enrich with getRelationships/getAircraftList/getCompany for full context.
- Always provide startdate/enddate + modelid/modlist/companyid to bound queries.

Use cases: ownership timeline (sort by transdate ASC), comparable sales (transtype=FullSale + transretail), leasing intelligence, change detection alerts.

## Snapshot Endpoint (getCondensedSnapshot)

Returns frozen fleet ownership/operator state at a specific historical date. A "time machine" for fleet composition.

POST /api/Aircraft/getCondensedSnapshot/{apiToken}

Key behaviors:
- `snapshotdate` (MM/DD/YYYY) is the required defining parameter.
- Response key: `snapshotowneroperators` (array).
- Non-paged: returns full dataset in one response (can be multi-MB).
- Always filter by modlist, basecountry, maketype, or aclist to keep payloads manageable.
- Snapshot data is historical and immutable — cache aggressively.
- Conceptual model: Snapshot=STATE, History=CHANGE, Current=NOW, FlightData=ACTIVITY.

Use cases: historical fleet composition, "who owned this in year X?", market comparison across years, country fleet growth analysis.

## Model Market Trends (getModelMarketTrends)

POST /api/Model/getModelMarketTrends/{apiToken}

Monthly time-series at model-level granularity. One record per model per month.

Request: modlist (array of model IDs), displayRange (months), startdate (MM/DD/YYYY).
Response key: `modelMarketTrends` (camelCase with capital M).

Key fields per record: trend_year, trend_month, aircraft_for_sale_count, in_operation_count, avg_asking_price, high_asking_price, low_asking_price, avg_daysonmarket, avg_airframe_time, avg_engine_time, domestic_count, international_count, dealer_owned_count, end_user_count.

Derived metrics:
- Supply Pressure = aircraft_for_sale_count / in_operation_count
- Liquidity Score = inverse of avg_daysonmarket slope
- Price Trend Index = MoM change in avg_asking_price

Combine with Snapshots (state), History (transactions), Events (causal), and Flight Data (utilization) for full longitudinal analytics. See docs/trends.md for composite indicators and architecture.

## Events (getEventListPaged)

POST /api/Aircraft/getEventListPaged/{apiToken}/{pagesize}/{page}

Discrete, timestamped aircraft lifecycle changes. The atomic causal layer of the dataset.

Request: evcategory (array), evtype (array), startdate/enddate (MM/DD/YYYY), aclist, modlist.
Response key: `events` (array). Fields: aircraftid, make, model, sernbr, regnbr, yearmfr, date (ISO), subject, description.

Key behaviors:
- evcategory and evtype enum values are STRICT. Unrecognized values return errors inside responsestatus (HTTP 200).
- Use [] for both evcategory and evtype to return all events (safest default).
- Call GET /api/Utility/getEventCategories/{apiToken} and POST /api/Utility/getEventTypes/{apiToken} to discover valid values.
- Known categories: Aircraft Information, Company / Contact, Financial Documents, Market Status, Transaction.
- Example types: Change in Aircraft Base, Change in Airframe Total Time, Ownership Transfer, For Sale / Off Market.
- Priority: Transaction + Market Status = HIGH, Aircraft Information = MEDIUM, Financial Documents + Company/Contact = LOW.
- Events explain WHY snapshots and trends changed (ownership transfers, listings, accidents, lifecycle transitions).
- Use for: lifecycle timelines, market velocity, ownership churn, pre-listing detection, event-driven alerts, signal engines.

Analytics stack: EVENTS (raw) -> SNAPSHOTS (state) -> TRENDS (analytics).

## Flight Data Endpoints

Two endpoints for flight intelligence:

getFlightData (POST, paged) -- Granular per-flight records. Response key: flightdata.
  Required filters: startdate/enddate (MM/DD/YYYY), plus modlist or aclist.
  Fields: flightid, flightdate, origin, destination, flighttime, distance, estfuelburn, estCO2emissions, callsign.
  Ingestion strategy: batch by model + daily/weekly date windows.

getFlights (GET) -- GET /api/Aircraft/getFlights/{aircraftId}/{apiToken}
  Monthly utilization aggregates: flightyear, flightmonth, flights (count), flighthours.
  Response key: flights.
  Use for: utilization trends, CRM scoring, benchmarking.

Use getFlightData for route intelligence and emissions. Use getFlights for monthly trend analysis.

## Contact Endpoints

Contact is a relationship hub connecting companies, aircraft, and listings. Join key: contactid.

getContactList (POST) -- Search contacts by name, company, role. Non-paged.
  Response key: contacts. Fields: contactid, firstname, lastname, title, companyname, companyid.

getContactListPaged (POST, paged) -- Same as getContactList but with pagination.
  Response key: contactlist (NOT contacts -- key changes between variants).

getContact (GET) -- Full contact record by contactid.
  URL: /api/Contact/getContact/{contactId}/{apiToken}
  Response key: contact. Fields: contactid, firstname, lastname, title, suffix, companyname, companyid, address fields.

getIdentification (GET) -- Lightweight identification record.
  URL: /api/Contact/getIdentification/{contactId}/{apiToken}

getPhonenumbers (GET) -- Phone numbers for a contact. Returns null (not []) when empty.
  URL: /api/Contact/getPhonenumbers/{contactId}/{apiToken}

getOtherlistings (GET) -- Alternate company/contact associations.
  URL: /api/Contact/getOtherlistings/{contactId}/{apiToken}

getContAircraftRelationships (GET) -- Aircraft linked to a contact with relationship type.
  URL: /api/Contact/getContAircraftRelationships/{contactId}/{apiToken}

Workflow: search (getContactListPaged) → verify (getIdentification) → full profile (getContact) → aircraft linkage (getContAircraftRelationships) → phones → other listings.

## Company Endpoints

Company is the organizational node linking contacts, aircraft, and certifications. Join key: companyid.

getCompanyList (POST) -- Search companies by name, type, location. Non-paged.
  Response key: companies. Fields: companyid, companyname, city, state, country.

getCompanyListPaged (POST, paged) -- Same as getCompanyList but with pagination.
  Response key: companylist (NOT companies -- key changes between variants).

getCompany (GET) -- Full company record by companyid.
  URL: /api/Company/getCompany/{companyId}/{apiToken}
  Response key: company. Includes nested objects.

getContacts (GET) -- Returns contact ID arrays only (not full objects). N+1 fan-out risk.
  URL: /api/Company/getContacts/{companyId}/{apiToken}

getAircraftrelationships (GET) -- Aircraft tied to company with relationship details.
  isoperator is "Y"/"N" string, not boolean. ownerpercent can be null.

getRelatedcompanies (GET) -- Parent/child/affiliated companies. Returns null (not []) when empty.

getCompanyCertifications (GET) -- Regulatory certifications.

getCompanyHistory / getCompanyHistoryPaged -- Transaction history for a company.

Workflow: search (getCompanyListPaged) → validate (getCompany) → expand (getContacts, getAircraftrelationships) → link.

## Model Reference Endpoints

Four model-level endpoints keyed by modelid (AMODID). Cross-reference: references/model-id-table.json.

getModelMarketTrends (POST) -- See docs/trends.md. Response key: modelMarketTrends (camelCase).

getModelOperationCosts (POST) -- Operating cost projections. Response key: modeloperationcosts (lowercase).
  Key fields: fuel burn rate, cost categories, annualhours, fuelprice projections.
  Request body: ModelPerformanceOptions with modelid.

getModelPerformanceSpecs (POST) -- Airframe specs. Response key: modelperformancespecs (lowercase).
  Key fields: fuselage dimensions, cabin specs, range, speed, ceiling.

getModelIntelligence (POST) -- Model-level intelligence summary.

IMPORTANT: Response key casing is inconsistent -- modelMarketTrends (camelCase) vs modeloperationcosts/modelperformancespecs (lowercase).

## Airport Reference

getAirportList (POST) -- Geographic dimension table. Cache aggressively (low change frequency).
  URL: /api/Utility/getAirportList/{apiToken}
  Request params: name, city, state, statename, country, iata, icao, faaid.
  Response fields: airportid, name, city, state, country, iata, icao, faaid.
  Use ICAO as canonical key. Joins with flight data, events, snapshots for geographic analysis.

## Utility / Reference Endpoints

Cacheable dimension tables forming the metadata backbone. All via /api/Utility/.

getAircraftLifecycleStatus -- Lifecycle enum values. Cache: static (months).
getAircraftMakeList -- Manufacturer taxonomy. Cache: long-lived (weekly).
getAircraftModelList -- Model catalog with modelid, weightclass, categorysize. Cache: long-lived (weekly).
getAirframeJniqSizes -- JNIQ size categories. Cache: static.
getAirframeTypes -- FixedWing, Rotary. Cache: static.
getMakeTypeList -- Make type taxonomy. Cache: long-lived.
getWeightClassTypes -- Weight class categories. Cache: static.
getEventCategories -- 5 event categories. Cache: static.
getEventTypes -- Event type enum per category. Cache: static.
getCompanyBusinessTypes -- Business type taxonomy. Cache: long-lived.
getCountryList / getStateList -- Geographic reference. Cache: static.

Strategy: load all static endpoints once at startup, cache long-lived weekly, refresh session-level daily.

## MCP Server (AI Agent Integration)

The `mcp/` directory contains a Model Context Protocol server that lets AI agents
(Claude Desktop, Cursor, Copilot) query JETNET data natively via tool calls.

Install: pip install mcp httpx pydantic
Run (stdio): JETNET_EMAIL=... JETNET_PASSWORD=... python mcp/jetnet_mcp.py
Run (HTTP): TRANSPORT=http PORT=8000 JETNET_EMAIL=... JETNET_PASSWORD=... python mcp/jetnet_mcp.py

11 tools exposed:
  jetnet_golden_path -- Complete aircraft profile (tail -> specs + owner + pictures) in one call.
  jetnet_lookup_aircraft -- Tail number lookup, returns aircraftid for subsequent calls.
  jetnet_get_relationships -- Owner/operator/manager relationships for an aircraft.
  jetnet_get_flight_data -- Flight activity within a date range.
  jetnet_search_fleet -- Search fleet by model, for-sale status, country.
  jetnet_get_history -- Transaction history (sales, deliveries) by model/aircraft + date range.
  jetnet_get_market_trends -- Market analytics: for-sale count, avg price, days on market.
  jetnet_search_models -- Find AMODID values by name/make/ICAO code.
  jetnet_get_snapshot -- Fleet snapshot at a historical point in time (getCondensedSnapshot).
  jetnet_get_model_specs -- Performance specs: range, speed, cabin, payload (getModelPerformanceSpecs).
  jetnet_health_check -- Verify JETNET connection and credentials.

All tools handle auth, token refresh (50 min), pagination, responsestatus checks, and date validation automatically.
